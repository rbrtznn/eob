<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span lang="EN">Let us consider point (2), “</span>that the
intention of the filioque is different than that of the creed of 381.” Orthodox
theologians are aware <span lang="EN">that the West, confronted with lingering
Arianism</span><span lang="EN">, was pursuing a different theological agenda with
its modified creed. The <i class="calibre4">Clarification</i> published by the Vatican
introduces the context of the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> clause thus:</span></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The doctrine of the <em class="calibre4"><span>Filioque</span></em> must be understood and presented by the Catholic Church in such a way that it cannot appear to contradict the Monarchy of
the Father nor the fact that he is the sole origin (<i class="calibre4">arche, aitia</i>) of the
<i class="calibre4">ekporevsis</i> of the Spirit. The <em class="calibre4"><span>Filioque</span></em>
is, in fact, situated in a theological and linguistic context different from
that of the affirmation of the sole Monarchy of the Father, the one origin of
the Son and of the Spirit. Against Arianism, which was still virulent in the
West, its purpose was to stress the fact that the Holy Spirit is of the same
divine nature as the Son, without calling in question the one Monarchy of the
Father.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span lang="EN">Mark Bonocore (RC) is also helpful in this
admission that:</span></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">So, to someone coming from this Eastern heritage—indeed,
for any Greek-speaker who knows what the term “ekporeusis” implies (i.e.,
procession from a single source, principal, or cause), the addition of the
Latin clause “Filioque” (“and the Son”) seriously challenges, if not totally
destroys, the originally-intended meaning of this Creedal statement. And we
Roman Catholics fully agree and admit this. <span class="calibre34">The introduction of the Filioque
is clearly a departure from the original intention and design of</span> the A.D.
381 version of the <span class="calibre34">Constantinopolitan Creed.</span> However, it is not a
departure from apostolic orthodoxy.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In other words, official Roman Catholicism teaches that the
Latin <i class="calibre4">procedit</i> used in the Vulgate to translate the Greek <i class="calibre4">ekporeutai</i>
had in fact a wider meaning, not only that of ‘having its cause and origin in,’
but “a wide implication.” In fact, it is explained that <i class="calibre4">procedit</i> was
understood as equivalent to <i class="calibre4">proinai</i>, a concept which can be a source of
confusion between economy and ontology.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Bonocore continues:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">But, if the Western Church agrees with the East
that the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, then what does it mean by “Filioque” –that the Spirit proceeds “from the Father and the Son?” When the West speaks of
the Spirit “proceeding” from the Father and the Son, it is referring to
something all-together different than “procession” as from a single source
(aitia). It is not advocating two sources or principals for the Spirit, or some
kind of “double spiration,” as is all-too-commonly (wrongly) assumed by many
Eastern Orthodox. Rather, it is using the term “proceeds” in an altogether
different sense. And the best way to illustrate the two different senses or
uses of the term “proceeds” (Greek vs. Latin) is though the following analogy: </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">If a human father and son go into their back
yard to play a game of catch, it is the father who initiates the game of catch
by throwing the ball to his son. In this sense, one can say that the game of
catch “proceeds” from this human father (an “aition”); and this is the
original, Greek sense of the Constantinopolitan Creed’s use of the term
“proceeds” (“ekporeusis”). However, taking this very same scenario, one can
also justly say that the game of catch “proceeds” from both the father and his
son. And this is because the son has to be there for the game of catch to
exist. For, unless the son is there, then the father would have no one to throw
the ball to; and so there would be no game of catch. And, it is in this sense
(one might say a “collective” sense) that the West uses the term “proceeds”
(“procedit”) in the Filioque. Just as acknowledging the necessity of the human
son’s presence in order for the game of catch to exist does not, in any way,
challenge or threaten the human father’s role as the source or initiator
(aition) of the game of catch, so the Filioque does not deny the Father’s
singular role as the Cause (Aition) of the Spirit; but merely acknowledges the
Son’s necessary Presence (i.e., participation) for the Spirit’s eternal
procession from the Father to Someone else –namely, to the eternal Son. Father
and Son are thus collectively identified as accounting for the Spirit’s
procession. This is all that the Filioque was ever intended to address.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This type of analogy is of course puzzling for the Orthodox
reader. It always seems that the West tends to define the Spirit in terms of
what is common between the Father and Son, which may depersonalize the Spirit
while affirming the Father and Son as the two real ‘co-partners’ and ‘co-monarchs.’
However, we can also perceive that in a certain sense, a carefully expressed <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>,
with the right verb (<i class="calibre4">and not that of the Creed</i>), can be an acceptable
orthodox opinion. </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This is the respected assessment of Metropolitan John
(Zizioulas):</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Another important point in the Vatican document
is the emphasis it lays on the distinction between <span>ἐ</span><span>κ</span>π<span>όρευσις</span>
and processio. It is historically true that in the Greek tradition a clear
distinction was always made between <span>εκ</span>π<span>ορεύεσθαι</span>
and π<span>ροείναι</span>,
the first of these two terms denoting exclusively the Spirit’s derivation from
the Father alone, whereas π<span>ροείναι</span>
was used to denote the Holy Spirit’s dependence on the Son owing to the common
substance or <span>ουσία</span>
which the Spirit in deriving from the Father alone as Person or <span>υ</span>π<span>όστασις</span>
receives from the Son, too, as <span>ουσιωδώς</span>
that is, with regard to the one <span>ουσία</span>
common to all three persons (Cyril of Alexandria, Maximus the Confessor et al). On the basis of this distinction one might argue that there is a
kind of <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> on the level of <span>ουσία</span>,
but not of <span>υ</span>π<span>όστασις</span>.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">However, as the document points out, the
distinction between <span>εκ</span>π<span>ορεύεσθαι</span>
and π<span>ροείναι</span>
was not made in Latin theology, which used the same term, procedere, to denote
both realities. Is this enough to explain the insistence of the Latin tradition
on the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i>? Saint Maximus the Confessor seems to think so. For him the <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i> was not heretical because its intention was to denote
not the <span>εκ</span>π<span>ορεύεσθαι</span>
but the π<span>ροείναι</span>
of the Spirit.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Since Zizioulas refers to St. Maximus the Confessor, it will useful to hear from the respected Father how the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> could
have an orthodox meaning:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">For the procession they [those at Rome] brought
the witness of the Latin Fathers, as well, of course, as that of St Cyril of
Alexandria in his sacred study on the Gospel of St John. On this basis they
showed that they themselves do not make the Son Cause (<span>αίτία</span>) of the
Spirit. They know, indeed, that the Father is the sole cause of the Son and of
the Spirit, of one by generation and of the other by <span>ἐ</span><span>κ</span>π<span>όρευσις</span>—but
they explained that the latter comes (π<span>ροϊέναι</span>)
through the Son, and they showed in this way the unity and the immutability of
the essence.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Based on this clarification, if the verb is <i class="calibre4">proinai</i>,
then “though the Son” is orthodox. Likewise, “and the Son” (understood as
strict equivalent to “through the Son”) is also acceptable. However, it is now
clear that “and the Son” cannot be added to the Greek verb <i class="calibre4">ekporev- </i>under
any circumstance, while even “through the Son” is very problematic.</p>
