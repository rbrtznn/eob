<p class="msonormal1">We now turn to evidence against the inclusion of Mark
16:9-20, notably the testimony of Clement of Alexandria (who died in the early
200s) and Origen (who died in 254), as well as the evidence from the Ethiopic
version. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">Regarding Clement, we should first observe that there is a
possible citation of Mark 16:19 in Clement’s <i class="calibre4">Adumbrationes on Jude 24</i>,
as preserved by the Latin writer Cassiodorus. Also, in Clement’s major works <i class="calibre4">(Exhortation
to the Heathen, The Instructor, Stromata,  </i>and<i class="calibre4"> Who Is the Rich Man That
Shall Be Saved?), </i>he did not use any text from Mark chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 16. Hence, his non-use of any 12-verse section of Mark
does not say anything conclusive about its presence or absence in his copies of
Mark.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Regarding Origen, we can picture the text of the Gospel of
Mark as a pizza, divided into 56 or 57 slices, with each slice containing 12
verses. In the works of Origen available to the modern English reader, Origen
did not use 34 of those slices. So, as Michael Holmes has affirmed, the
testimony of Clement and Origen “is an argument from silence, so not too much
weight can be placed on it.” Those who encounter Bruce Metzger’s widely
circulated claim that “Clement of Alexandria and Origen show no knowledge of
the existence of these verses”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2896" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2896"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2896]</span></span></span></a>
should be aware that Clement shows knowledge of no more than 23 of Mark’s 678
verses, and Origen, in all his accessible writings, shows no knowledge of 34
other 12-verse sections of Mark. Such incidental silence, overshadowing almost
15 chapters of Mark in the case of Clement, and over half of the text of Mark
in the case of Origen, is insufficient to establish the contents of the MSS
used by Clement and Origen.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Nevertheless, several scholars (such as James A. Brooks,
Philip Wesley Comfort, and Sharyn Dowd) have given their readers the impression
that the ending at 16:8 is fully attested by Clement and Origen. </p>
