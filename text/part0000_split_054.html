<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>We have much to say about these things but it
is hard to explain because you have become slow at understanding. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>For
although by this time you should be teachers, you still need to have someone
teach you [even] the basic principles of God’s oracles. You have come to need
milk, and not solid food! <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Everyone who lives on milk is not
experienced in the word of righteousness; such a person is a baby. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>But
solid food is for those who are fully grown, who have trained their senses to

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_6">6</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Therefore, going beyond the teaching of the basic principles
about Christ, let us move on to perfection! Let us not lay again a foundation
of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God, <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>of the teaching
of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
judgment. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>If God allows, let us do this. </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Regarding those who were once enlightened, who

the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>but then
fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance! They crucify the

the other hand, the land which has absorbed the rain that comes often upon it
and thus brings forth a crop suitable for those who till it—such a land
receives blessing from God. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Yet if it bears thorns and thistles, it
is rejected, close to being cursed; and its end is to be burned.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But, beloved, even though we speak like this, we
are persuaded of better things for you, of things that accompany salvation. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>God
is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you
showed for his Name by serving the saints even as you still serve them. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>We
desire that each one of you may show the same zeal to the end, to [obtain] the
fullness of hope. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Do not be sluggish, but imitate those who

<p class="sectiontopic">God’s unchangeable oath</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>When God made a promise to Abraham, since he

<sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Thus, having patiently endured, Abraham obtained the promise. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>For
humans indeed swear by someone greater, and in every dispute they have, the
oath is final to get things settled. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>In this way, being determined
to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of
his purpose, God intervened with an oath. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>And so, by two
unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, may we have a
strong encouragement, since we have sought refuge and taken hold of the hope
set before us. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>We have this hope as an anchor of the soul, a hope
which is both sure and solid. It reaches beyond the veil, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>where
Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever
after the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Melchizedek, Abraham, and Christ</p>

<p class="style35ptloweredby1ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_7">7</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This Melchizedek was king of Salem, priest of God Most High,
who met Abraham when he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and who
blessed him. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Moreover, Abraham gave a tenth part of all to this
Melchizedek! By the interpretation of his name, he is, first, ‘king of saving
justice’ and also king of Salem, that is, ‘king of peace;’ <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>without
father, mother, or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.
He was made like the Son of God and remains a priest for all times. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Now
consider how great this man was, since even the Patriarch Abraham gave him a
tenth from the best spoils! <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Indeed, the sons of Levi who receive
the priestly office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according
to the law, that is, of their brethren, although they too are Abraham’s
descendants. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But this man, who was not of the same descent,
received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who has the promises! <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Now
nobody will question that the lesser is blessed by the greater. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Here,
the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is
declared to be living. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>We can say that through Abraham even Levi
(who would [later] receive tithes), had paid tithes, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>for he was
still ‘in the body’ of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Now
if perfection had come through the Levitical priesthood (under which the people
received the law), what further need would there be for another priest to arise
according to the order of Melchizedek and not that of Aaron? <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>And
as the priesthood is being changed, there is also, by necessity, a change in
the law as well. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>So our Lord,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2167" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2167"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2167]</span></span></span></a>
of whom these things were said, belongs to another tribe, one from which no one
has served at the altar. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>It is clear indeed that our Lord came
from the tribe of Judah, about which Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
<sup class="calibre31">15</sup>This is even more obvious if after the likeness of Melchizedek,
another priest was to rise, <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>one who was not made in virtue of a
law of physical descent but according to the power of an indestructible life. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>For
he testifies:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">You are a priest forever,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">according to the order of Melchizedek.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2168" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2168"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2168]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>There is a cancellation of an earlier
commandment on account of its weakness and uselessness, <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>because
the law made nothing perfect. But [now], there is the introduction of a better
hope through which we draw near to God. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Moreover, our Lord<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2169" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2169"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2169]</span></span></span></a>
was not made priest without the taking of an oath <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>(although others
became priests without any oath). But with an oath, God says of him:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">The Lord swore and will not change his mind,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">‘You are a priest forever,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">according to the order of Melchizedek.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2170" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2170"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2170]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Because of this, Jesus has become the guarantee
of a better covenant. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Many, indeed, were made priests [in the
past] because they are prevented from continuing in office when they die. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>But
because he lives forever, Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2171" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2171"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2171]</span></span></span></a>

priesthood. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Therefore, he is also able to save to the very end
those who draw near to God through him, because he lives forever to make
intercession for them.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Indeed, such a high priest was fitting for us:
holy, blameless, undefiled,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2173" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2173"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2173]</span></span></span></a>
separated from sinners and made higher than the heavens. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>He does
not need, like those [former] high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first
for his own sins and then for the sins of the people. Instead, he did this once
for all, when he offered himself up. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>For the law appoints as high
priests men who have weaknesses, but the word of the oath which came after the
law appoints forever a Son who has been perfected.</p>

much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2189" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2189"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2189]</span></span></span></a>
offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works
to offer divine service to the living God? <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>For this reason, he is
the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption
of the sins that were under the first covenant, so that those who have been
called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Where
there is a last will and testament, there must also be the death of the one who
made it. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>A will comes into effect after death; it is never in
force while the one who made it is still alive. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>That is why not
even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>For when
Moses had proclaimed every commandment to all the people according to the law,
he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop,
and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>saying:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2190" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2190"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2190]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Moreover, he sprinkled the tabernacle and all
the vessels of the ministry in the same way, with the blood. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>According
to the law, almost everything is purified with blood, and there is no remission
[of sins] if there is no shedding of blood. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Therefore, it was
necessary that the copies of the heavenly things should be cleansed with these
things, but the heavenly things themselves [had to be purified] with better sacrifices<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2191" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2191"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2191]</span></span></span></a>
than these. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>For Christ did not enter into holy places made with
hands, which are representations of the true [holy places], but into heaven
itself in order to appear in the presence of God for us. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Yet, this
did not take place so that he would offer himself often, as the [Levitical]
high priest does when he enters into the holy place year by year, with blood
that is not his own. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Otherwise, Christ<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2192" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2192"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2192]</span></span></span></a>
would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now, at
the end of the ages, he has been revealed once to put away sin by the sacrifice
of himself. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>It is appointed for humans to die once, and after this
comes the judgment. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>It is the same with Christ: having been
offered once to bear the sins of many,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2193" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2193"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2193]</span></span></span></a>
he will appear a second time, apart from sin-offering, to those who are eagerly
waiting for him for salvation.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2194" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2194"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2194]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_10">10</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The law had a shadow of the good [things] to come but not
the very image of their reality; for this reason, it can never make perfect
those who draw near with the same repetitive annual sacrifices. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Or
else, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who offer
divine service,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2195" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2195"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2195]</span></span></span></a>
having been cleansed, would no longer have felt guilty for their past sins? <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>But
in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>[This is]
because it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away
sins. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">but you have prepared a body for me;</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>First he said, “Sacrifices, offerings, whole
burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin you did not desire, neither had
pleasure in them” (those which are offered according to the law), <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>and
then he said, “Behold, I have come to do your will, O God.” He takes away the
first so that he may establish the second [testament], <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>and by this
will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ,
once for all! <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Every priest indeed stands serving daily, repeatedly
offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>But
Christ,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2197" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2197"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2197]</span></span></span></a>
after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand
of God, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his
feet. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>By one offering, he has perfected forever those who are
being sanctified. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after
saying before:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>This is the covenant that I will make with
them:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">‘After those days,’ says the Lord,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">‘I will put my laws on their heart,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">I will also write them on their minds.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2198" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2198"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2198]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>He then says:</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Now where there is remission of these sins,

<p class="sectiontopic">Boldness in Christ</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Brethren, we have boldness to enter into the
holy place by the blood of Jesus, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>by the way which he opened for
us (a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh). <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Yes,
since we have a great priest over the house of God, <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>let us draw
near with a true heart full of faith. Since our hearts have been sprinkled from
an evil conscience and our body washed with pure water, <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>let us
hang on to the confession of our hope without wavering because the one who made
the promise is faithful.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Let us consider one another, how we may
stimulate love and good works. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Let us not abandon our own
gatherings, which is the habit of some. Instead, exhort one another, and even
more as you see the Day approaching. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>But if we sin willfully after
receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is no more sacrifice for sins. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>All
that remains is a fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire which will
devour the adversaries. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>One who disregards Moses’ law dies without
compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>How much worse a
punishment, do you think, will one receive who has trampled the Son of God and
profaned the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified, and offended
the Spirit of grace? <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>For we know him who said, “Vengeance is mine,
I will repay, says the Lord.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2200" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2200"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2200]</span></span></span></a>

<sup class="calibre31">31</sup>It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God! <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>But
remember the early days when you had just been enlightened, how you endured a
great struggle with sufferings. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>Sometimes you were exposed to
insults and oppressions; and at other times you stood with those who were
treated in such a way. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>Indeed, you had compassion for me in my
chains and joyfully accepted the seizure of your property, knowing that you
have a better and enduring property in the heavens. <sup class="calibre31">35</sup>Therefore, do
not throw away your confidence which has a great reward. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>Indeed,
you need endurance in order to receive the promise after having done the will
of God:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">In a very little while,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">he who comes will come and will not wait.</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_11">11</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Now faith is the personal foundation<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2203" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2203"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2203]</span></span></span></a>
of things hoped for, certainty about things that cannot be seen. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>By
this, people of old obtained approval. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>By faith, we understand that
the universe was formed by the word of God, so that what is visible was made
from what is invisible.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>By faith, Abel offered to God a sacrifice more
excellent than Cain’s, and through this a testimony was given to him that he
was righteous. God testified about his gifts, and although Abel is now dead, he
still speaks. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>By faith, Enoch was taken away in order not to see death:
he was not found because God had translated him. He too had received a
testimony that before his translation, he had been well-pleasing to God.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Without faith it is impossible to please God,
for whoever comes to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those
who seek him.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>By faith, Noah, being warned about things not
yet seen, was moved with godly fear. He prepared a ship to save his household
and by this means he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness
which is according to faith. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>By faith, Abraham, when he was called,
obeyed and left the place which he was supposed to receive as his inheritance.
He left, not knowing where he was going. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>By faith, he lived as an
alien in the land of the promise, as in a land that was not his own, dwelling
in tents with Isaac and Jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Indeed,
Abraham looked for the city which has foundations and whose architect and
builder is God. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>By faith, even Sarah received power to conceive
and she bore a child when she was past the age because she considered that the
one who had promised was faithful. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Therefore, one man became the
father to [people] as numerous as the stars of the sky and as innumerable as
the sand on the sea shore, even though he was as good as dead. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>These
people all died in faith, [yet] not having received the promises. <a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2204" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2204"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2204]</span></span></span></a>They
had seen and embraced them from afar, and they confessed that they were
strangers and pilgrims upon the earth. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Certainly, people who say
such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>If
they had been thinking of the country they had originally left, they would have
had enough time to return. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>But in fact, they desire a better
country, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed of them, or ashamed to
be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>By faith, Abraham, when he was tested, offered

<sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Abraham concluded that God was even able to raise up the dead and

<p class="sectiontopic">Call to be careful, having approached the awesome God</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Pursue peace with everyone, and also

without which no one will see the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Be careful, for fear that
any of you might fall short of the grace of God or that any root of bitterness
should trouble you; many are poisoned by this. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Be careful that
there is no sexually immoral or profane person [among you], like Esau who sold
his birthright for a meal. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>As you know, even when he later on

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>As it is, you have not come to a mountain that
can be touched; or that burned with fire. [You have not come] to gloom,
darkness, storm, <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words
which made those who heard it beg that not one more word should be spoken to
them! <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Indeed, they could not endure what was commanded, “If even

<p class="sectiontopic">Worshiping with reverence and awe</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">25</sup>See that you do not refuse to listen to the one
who speaks! For if they did not escape when they rejected the one who warned on
the Earth, we will certainly not escape if we turn away from the one who warns
from heaven! <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>His voice shook the earth then, but now he has
promised with these words, “Yet again, I shake not only the earth, but also the

<p class="sectiontopic">Final exhortations</p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt">13</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Continue loving each other as brethren. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Do not
forget to be hospitable to strangers, for in doing so, some have welcomed
angels without knowing it!<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2234" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2234"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2234]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Remember those who are in chains, as if chained with them, and also
those who are ill-treated, as if you too were suffering in the body. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Marriage
must be held in honor among all and the [marriage] bed [kept] undefiled:<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2235" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2235"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2235]</span></span></span></a>
but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Be free from the love of money and be satisfied
with what you have. As God has said:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake
you.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2236" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2236"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2236]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>And so, we say with good courage:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">The Lord is my helper, I will not fear.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">What can man do to me?<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2237" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2237"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2237]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Remember your leaders, those men who proclaimed
the word of God to you. Considering the results of their conduct, imitate their
faith. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Do
not be carried away by all sorts of strange teachings. It is good that the
inner person<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2238" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2238"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2238]</span></span></span></a>
should be strengthened by grace, not by food which is of no profit to those who
have been preoccupied by it!</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>We have an altar from which those who offer
divine service<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2239" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2239"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2239]</span></span></span></a>
[in] the holy tabernacle have no right to eat. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>For the bodies of
those animals (whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as
an offering for sin) are burned outside of the camp.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2240" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2240"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2240]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">12</sup>This is why Jesus suffered outside of the gate, so that he might
sanctify the people through his own blood. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Let us therefore go out
[of the city] to him who is outside of the camp and let us bear his disgrace. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>For
we do not have here [on earth] an enduring city, but we seek the one that is to
come. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Therefore, through him, [Jesus], let us continually offer up
a sacrifice of praise to God,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2241" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2241"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2241]</span></span></span></a>
the fruit of our lips which confessed his Name. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>But do not forget
to do what is good and to share because God is well pleased with such
sacrifices.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Obey your leaders and submit to them as they
watch over your souls as people who will give an account. This way, they will
be able to do this with joy and not with grief because that would not be
profitable for you.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Pray for us: we trust that we have a good
conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>I strongly
urge you to pray for this: that I may be restored to you sooner.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Now may the God of peace, who with the blood of
an eternal covenant brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep,
our Lord Jesus, <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>make you complete in every good work so that you
may do his will. May God<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2242" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2242"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2242]</span></span></span></a>
work in you what is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom
be the glory unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>But I exhort you, brethren: take this word of
exhortation attentively since I have written to you briefly. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Know
that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will see you
with him. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from
Italy greet you. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Grace be with you all! Amen.</p>
