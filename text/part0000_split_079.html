<p class="msonormal1">Because the Church is made manifest in the mystery of the
Eucharist, the one ordained and consecrated to preside over its celebration
(“the bishop”) has an essential role in the divine economy of salvation. The
words of St. Cyprian are as true today as in the middle of the third century:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">From these things, you should know that the bishop
is in the Church, and the Church in the bishop; and that anyone who is not [united]
with the bishop is not in the Church. (Epistle 68, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">Florentius</i> <i class="calibre4">Pupianus</i>)</p>
