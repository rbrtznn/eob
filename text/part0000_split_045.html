in Christ. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>He chose us in him before the foundation of the world,
so that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>He
also foreordained us for adoption {as his children} through Jesus Christ
according to his purpose and will. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>This is to the praise of the
glory of his grace, by which he made us accepted in the Beloved. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>In
him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins,
according to the riches of his grace <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>which he showered upon us in
all wisdom and insight.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1929" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1929"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[1929]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">9</sup>He has revealed to us the mystery of his will, according to his
good pleasure which he had determined beforehand in Christ. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>This
came into effect when the times had been fulfilled, to bring together all
things under Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth;
yes, in him! <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>In him, an inheritance was assigned to us,
foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the
counsel of his will. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>[And the end result is] that we, who had
hoped in Christ, should be to the praise of his glory. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>In him you
also, when you heard the word of the truth which is the Good News of your
salvation, and having believed in it, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of

of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of his glory! </span></p>

<sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Yes, Christ now sits above all rule, authority, power, dominion,
and every name that can be named, not only in this age, but also in the age to
come. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>God put all things in subjection under his feet and granted

God who is rich in mercy, on account of his great love by which he loved us, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>even
when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.

Christ Jesus, <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>so that in the ages to come, he might show the
overflowing treasure of his grace in kindness toward us, in Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Yes,
by grace you have been saved through faith, and not by yourselves. It is the
gift of God, <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>not of works, so that no one would boast. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>For
we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
prepared in advance so that we should walk in them.</p>

Christ. You were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from
the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>But
now, in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near in the
blood of Christ. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>He is our peace, he who made both [groups to be]

<sup class="calibre31">15</sup>He abolished in his flesh the enmity which is the law of commandments
with its decrees, so that he might create in himself one new humanity instead
of two, making peace. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>He reconciled both [groups] to God in one
body, through the cross, by which he destroyed that enmity. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>He
came and preached peace to you who were far off and also to those who were
near. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Through him, we both have access to the Father in one

Instead, [you are] fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s
household, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>being built on the foundation of the apostles and

the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>In
him, you too are built up into a dwelling place of God in [the] Spirit.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1936" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1936"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[1936]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1">For this reason, I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on

you read them, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>which
in other generations was not made known to anyone as it has now been revealed

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Of this Good News, I was made a servant,
according to the gift of God’s grace which was given me according to the
working of his power. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>This grace was given to me, the very least of
all saints, so that I might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable

also pray that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, so that you may
