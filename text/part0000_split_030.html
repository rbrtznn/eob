have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have
been fulfilled among us, <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>even as those who were eyewitnesses and
servants of the word since the beginning have delivered them to us. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>[For

things accurately from the beginning, to write an ordered account to you, most
excellent Theophilus, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>so that you may know the certainty of the
things you have been taught.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The birth of John the Baptist is announced</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre67">5</span></sup><span class="calibre67">In the days of Herod king of Judea, there lived a
priest named Zacharias who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah. He had
a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Both
of them were righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments
and ordinances of the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Yet, they had no child because
Elizabeth was barren, and both were well advanced in years. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Now it
came to pass that while Zacharias was performing his priestly office before God
in the order of his division, <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>according to the custom of the
priest’s office, that his lot was [drawn] to enter into the sanctuary<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn615" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref615"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre77">[615]</span></span></span></a> of the Lord and burn
incense. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Now at the time of the incense offering, the whole
multitude of the people was praying outside.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him,
standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Zacharias was
startled when he saw the angel and was gripped with fear. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>But the
angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your petition has been
heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name
John. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his
birth. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Indeed, he will be great in the sight of the Lord! He will
drink no wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even
from his mother’s womb. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>He will bring back many of the children of
Israel to the Lord their God. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>He will go before the Lord<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn616" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref616"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[616]</span></span></span></a>
in the spirit and power of Elias (Elijah), ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers
to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready
a people prepared for the Lord.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure
of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel who
stands near before God.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn617" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref617"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[617]</span></span></span></a>

<sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that
these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be
fulfilled in their proper time.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>The people were waiting for Zacharias and
wondering as he delayed in the sanctuary. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>When he came out, he
could not speak to them and they understood that he had seen a vision in the
sanctuary. He continued to make signs to them and remained mute. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>When
the days of his service were fulfilled, Zacharias returned to his house. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>After
these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she hid herself five months,
saying: <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>“The Lord has done this to me in the days when he looked
at me, in order to take away my disgrace among men.”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The Annunciation of the birth of Jesus</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was
sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>to a virgin
pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David.
The virgin’s name was Mary. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Having come in, the angel said to her,
“Rejoice,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn619" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref619"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[619]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre27">29</span></sup><span class="calibre27">But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at
his saying and considered what kind of greeting this might be. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>The
angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>Behold,
you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a son, and you will call his
name ‘Jesus.’ <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>He will be great and will be called the Son of the

be no end.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn622" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref622"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[622]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">38</sup>Mary said, “Behold, the handmaid<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn627" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref627"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[627]</span></span></span></a>

all your mind;<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn781" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref781"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[781]</span></span></span></a>
and your neighbor as yourself.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn782" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref782"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[782]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Jesus said to him, “You have answered
correctly. Do this, and you will live.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>But the lawyer, desiring to justify himself,
asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Then Jesus answered, “A certain man was going
down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped
him of his clothes and beat him. Then they went away, leaving him half dead. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>By
chance, a certain priest was going down that way. But when the priest saw him,
he passed by on the other side. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>In the same way, a Levite also came
to the place, but when he saw the beaten man, he [also] passed by on the other
side. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>Now a certain Samaritan was traveling and arrived at the
spot where the man was. When the Samaritan saw the wounded man,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn783" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref783"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[783]</span></span></span></a>
he was moved with compassion, <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>came to him, and wrapped his wounds,
pouring on oil and wine. He placed the man on his own animal and brought him to
an inn, and took care of him. <sup class="calibre31">35</sup>On the next day, when he was
leaving, he took out two denarii and gave them to the host, saying to him,
‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will pay you back when I
return.’ <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>Now which one of these three do you think seemed to be a
neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">37</sup>The lawyer replied, “The one who showed mercy
on him!”</p>
