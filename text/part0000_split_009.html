<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Most scholars recognize the existence of four families of
New Testament manuscripts: <b class="calibre7">Byzantine, Alexandrian, Western and Caesarean</b>.
Obviously, all of these are part of the historical heritage of Orthodox
Christianity.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The majority of (Greek) manuscripts available today belong
to the Byzantine type. They are all very close to the <b class="calibre7">Textus Receptus</b>
which underlies the KJV/NKJV, to the <b class="calibre7">Majority Text</b> which is
reconstructed based on the majority<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn4" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref4"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[4]</span></span></span></a>
of manuscripts, and to the <b class="calibre7">Patriarchal Text</b>. The Patriarchal Text of
1904 is indeed extremely close to modern editions of the Majority Text, such as
the Hodges &amp; Farstad of 1982 and Pierpont &amp; Robinson of 1991.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">On the other hand, there are significant variants between
TR/MT/PT and the Critical Text. These variants are documented in the EOB
footnotes. The reason for these “alternative readings” should be known and understood
by all Orthodox Christians. </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Based on the discovery of new manuscripts, especially
Sinaiticus, Vaticanus and ancient Egyptian papyri, modern textual critics analyze
the relative value of each manuscript with the laudable intention of recovering
the original reading of the New Testament autographs.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Codex<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn5" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref5"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[5]</span></b></span></span></a></b><b class="calibre7">

or 01) was discovered in 1859 by Constantin von Tischendorf when he was staying
at the Greek Orthodox Monastery of St. Catherine of Sinai. During his first
visit to the Monastery, Tischendorf had noticed what appeared to be very
ancient manuscripts in the wastebasket used for fire kindling. His excitement
and alarm at the content of the monastic wastebasket was noticed by the monks,
but in spite of the growing concern of his hosts, the German visitor was still
able to consult ancient texts of great value. When he returned to the Monastery
several years later to present as a gift his recently published edition of the
Septuagint, his monastic hosts expressed interest and appreciation. Tischendorf
writes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">On the afternoon of this day, I was taking a
walk with the steward of the convent in the neighborhood, and as we returned,
towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment with him in his cell.
Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of
conversation, he said: “And I, too, have read a Septuagint,” i.e. a copy of the
Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from the
corner of the room a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid
it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not
only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the
basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete,
and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Pastor of Hermas.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn7" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref7"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[7]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Tsar Alexander II, who had commissioned Tischendorf’s
expedition, sent the monastery 9,000 rubles to compensate the monastery for the
‘loss’ of the manuscript. It should be noted that Tischendorf had promised that
the codex would be returned to the monastery, but this never happened. Instead,
this ancient treasure was long kept by the Russian National Library and in
1933, the Soviet Union sold it to the British Library for £100,000.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Hence, Codex Sinaiticus is not only one of the oldest
manuscripts available today (330-350), it is also Orthodox in origin and was
not itself ‘discovered in a trash can’ as many mistakenly believe. On the other
hand, the codex is heavily corrected and may not be as reliable as modern
textual critics often claim.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Codex Vaticanus</b> (Vatican Library, Gregory-Aland no. B
or 03) is also one of the oldest extant manuscripts of the Bible. Its origins
are not known, but it has been suggested that Codex Vaticanus was among the fifty
bibles commissioned by Emperor St. Constantine I to Eusebius of Caesarea. The
EOB/OT and Brenton’s LXX are primarily based on this manuscript (except for 1-4
Maccabees and the Prayer of Manasseh which are absent).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Codex Alexandrinus</b> (British Library, Gregory-Aland
no. A or 02) is a 5th century manuscript containing the majority of the
Septuagint and the New Testament. It is also considered as one of the earliest
and most complete manuscripts of the Bible. It is named after the See of Alexandria
where it resided for a number of years until the 17th century when Patriarch Cyril
Lukaris offered it to the British Crown.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In general, the <b class="calibre7">Critical Text</b> follows Sinaiticus and
Vaticanus when they agree, which is rarer than one would expect. The Critical
Text also tends to follow Sinaiticus or Vaticanus when either one agrees with
ancient papyri and pre-Nicene quotations.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Inasmuch as the debate still rages among biblical scholars
regarding the relative merits of the Majority (Byzantine) Text versus the
so-called Critical/Alexandrian Text, the EOB always follows the Patriarchal
Text with textual signs such as footnotes, [ ], &lt;&gt;, and {}.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Although there are good scholarly arguments both for and
against using the Byzantine Majority Text over the Critical Text, many Orthodox
hierarchs and theologians take the following into consideration: </p>

<ul type="square" class="calibre33">
 <li class="body-list align-justify autospace-ideograph">When
     a scribe had a choice of manuscripts to copy, he would normally copy the
     one that he trusted the most, thus causing the most trusted text to be
     copied more often;</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify autospace-ideograph">The
     Holy Spirit takes an active interest in preserving what He has inspired
     and in what the Church has used for her liturgical life. At the very
     least, the Byzantine textual tradition reflects ‘the life of the Spirit in
     the Church’ and can be considered ‘the ecclesiastical text’ and an assured
     witness.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text align-justify autospace-ideograph"> </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify autospace-ideograph">It
is important to note that <i class="calibre4">no doctrine is ever at stake</i> on account of
these variant readings. Moreover, if ancient writers such as Origen, Irenaeus,
Basil or Chrysostom supported a non-Byzantine variant reading of significance,
this will be mentioned in a footnote. Again, it is important to note that the
main in-page wording of the EOB New Testament follows the
Patriarchal/ecclesiastical text.</p>
