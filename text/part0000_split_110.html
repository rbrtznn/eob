<p class="msonormal1">Furthermore, evidence that is older than Vaticanus and
Sinaiticus strongly supports Mark 16:9-20 as part of the Gospel of Mark. Our
oldest <i class="calibre4">manuscripts</i> are not always our oldest <i class="calibre4">evidence</i>. Early
Church writers frequently quoted from the New Testament, and their quotations,
when they are clear and explicit, echo the MSS used by those writers. </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Tatian.</b> In about 172, Tatian, who was a student of
Justin, took Justin’s idea of combining the Gospels one step farther, and
blended together the contents of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John into one
continuous story (minus the genealogies), known as the <i class="calibre4">Diatessaron</i>.
Tatian later embraced questionable doctrines, and his <i class="calibre4">Diatessaron</i>,
although once widely popular in Syria, was considered suspicious in the 400s.
As a result, no complete copies of it are known to exist in Greek or in Syriac.
But in a medieval Arabic copy of an earlier Syriac copy of the <i class="calibre4">Diatessaron</i>,
Mark 16:9-20 is included. In a Latin copy, Mark 16:9-20 is included. It is
important to notice that not only is Mark 16:9-20 included in both of these
major pieces of evidence about the contents of the <i class="calibre4">Diatessaron</i>, but that
they both arrange Mark 16:9-20 in essentially the same way, even though the
Arabic text and the Latin text are from two different backgrounds.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Irenaeus.</b> In about 184, Irenaeus, bishop of the city
of Lyons, in what is now France, wrote a lengthy composition called <i class="calibre4">Against
Heresies</i>. In the third volume (chapter 10), Irenaeus wrote, <i class="calibre4">“Toward the
conclusion of his Gospel, Mark says, ‘So then, after the Lord Jesus had spoken
to them, he was received up into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God.’” </i>This
is a direct reference to the Longer Ending.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Porphyry</b>. Porphyry was a pagan author who wrote <i class="calibre4">Against
the Christians</i>, a very long series of books, in about 270. His assistant
Hierocles made a condensed edition of Porphyry’s work, and extensive excerpts this
edition are embedded in a composition called <i class="calibre4">Apocriticus</i>, by a Christian
writer named Macarius Magnes, who wrote around 405. Macarius did not know the
name of the pagan author whose objections he was answering, but at least one of
the unusual objections (specifically, the charge that Peter had killed Ananias
and Sapphira) he addressed was identified by the scholar Jerome as an objection
made by Porphyry. In <i class="calibre4">Apocriticus</i> III:16, Macarius of Magnesia provided
the following quotation from the pagan text: “Again, consider in detail that
other passage, where he says, ‘Such signs shall follow them that believe: they
shall lay hands upon sick folk, and they shall recover, and if they drink any
deadly drug, it shall in no wise hurt them.’ So the right thing would be for
those selected for the priesthood, and particularly those who lay claim to the
episcopate or presidency, to make use of this form of test.” This quotation is
loose, but it is perfectly clear that Porphyry is referring to Mark 16:17-18.
This citation is framed between quotations from John 6:53 and Matthew 17:20,
which shows that Porphyry was using a copy of the Gospels. (Macarius, rather
than claim that the passage was not in some copies, attempted to answer by
interpreting the passage allegorically.)</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Acts of Pilate</b>. In the apocryphal composition called <i class="calibre4">Acts
of Pilate</i> (which is generally dated from the early 300s, about the time
when Codex Vaticanus was made), there is, in chapter 14, a scene in which some
individuals report to the religious leaders of Jerusalem that they saw the
risen Jesus “sitting upon the mountain which is called Mamilch, and he said
unto his disciples: Go into all the world and preach unto every creature: whoever
believes and is baptized shall be saved, but whoever does not believe shall be
condemned.” In some copies, the text also includes 16:17-18, but even with only
16:15-16 embedded in the text, it is clear that the author of Acts of Pilate
was acquainted with Mark 16:9-20. </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Eusebius of Caesarea</b>. In about 330, the historian and
bishop Eusebius of Caesarea answered a series of questions from a contemporary
named Marinus about passages in the Gospels – especially passages near the ends
of the Gospels – that seemed difficult to harmonize. Marinus asked one question
about how to harmonize Matthew 28:1 with Mark 16:9: “How is it that in Matthew,
the risen Savior appears ‘late on the Sabbath’ but in Mark ‘early on the first
day of the week’?” Eusebius answered along the following lines:</p>

<p class="msonormal32">There are two
potential solutions: a person could reject the entire passage, claiming that it
does not appear in all the copies of the Gospel of Mark; the accurate copies,
at least, conclude after the statement that the women fled and said nothing to
anyone, for they were afraid. For there the Gospel of Mark comes to a close in
almost all the copies. The material that comes afterwards is in some copies,
but not in all, and it may be spurious, especially since it implies a
disagreement with the testimony of the other Gospels. That is what a person might
say in order to avoid and dismiss a superfluous question.</p>

<p class="msonormal32">On the other
hand, someone else, who dares to set aside nothing that appears in the text of
the Gospels, however it got there, says that the passage has two meanings, and
both must be accepted, because they are endorsed by faithful and pious people.
And since it is granted that this passage is true, it is appropriate to seem to
understand what it means. If we accurately discern the meaning of the words, we
will not find a contradiction of what Matthew says: ‘late on the Sabbath’ the
Savior was raised. We will read Mark’s ‘And having risen early on the first day
of the week’ with a pause: after ‘And having risen,’ we shall add a comma, and
we will separate what is read next. Thus we could understand ‘And having risen’
to refer to the time to which Matthew specified, and understand the next phrase
to be, ‘early on the first day of the week, he appeared to Mary Magdalene.’ </p>

<p class="msonormal32">At any rate,
John made this clear, and testified that the appearance to Mary Magdalene was
‘early on the first day of the week.’ So, likewise, in Mark also he appeared
‘early’ to her. The implication is that Matthew and Mark refer to two episodes:
one is the time of the resurrection, which was late on the Sabbath; the other
is the time of the appearance of the Savior, which was early. Mark referred to
the later time, so we should read, “And having risen,” and then, after adding a
comma, one must read the rest: “early on the first day of the week he appeared
to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">From this lengthy comment, we may understand a few things:
first, Marinus knew only a form of Mark that included 16:9-20. Second, Eusebius
possessed some copies of Mark that contained 16:9-20, as well as copies that
ended at the end of 16:8, and he considered these copies to be “accurate
copies.” Fourth, although Eusebius mentioned the option of rejecting Mark
16:9-20, Eusebius did not insist on its excision; instead, he explained how to
harmonize it with Matthew 28:1, obviously expecting Marinus to choose that
option. Fifth, Eusebius did not seem to be aware of any copies with the so-called
Shorter Ending.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In addition, as Eusebius answered Marinus’ next question
(about how Mary Magdalene could visit the tomb with another woman in Matthew,
and visit by herself in John), he mentioned that “in some copies” of Mark, it
is said that Jesus cast out seven demons from Mary Magdalene.           It may
be worthwhile to observe that during the Diocletian persecution, which ended
about 25 years before Eusebius wrote to Marinus, many Christian manuscripts
throughout the Roman Empire had been destroyed, and no one had the ability to
survey all the surviving copies in all the churches. Eusebius’ statements refer
to copies which he had personally seen, heard/read about, or which were stored
at the library at Caesarea.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Eusebius eventually settled on a position against the
inclusion of Mark 16:9-20. When he made the Eusebian Canons – a detailed set of
cross-reference tables to guide readers through the parallel-passages in the
Gospels – he did not include Mark 16:9-20. Five medieval MSS mention this in an
annotation to 16:9.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Wulfilas</b>. Wulfilas translated the New Testament into
the Gothic language in about 350. In the Gothic version, Mark 16:9-20 is in the
Gospel of Mark. For a long time, the most important Gothic manuscript of the
Gospels, Codex Argenteus (from the 500s), was missing the last page of Mark. In
1970, it was discovered by Franz Haffner in a collection of relics in Speyer,
Germany. This shows that the copies used by Wulfilas in 350, (about the same
time that Codex Sinaiticus was made) did include Mark 16:9-20.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Ambrose of Milan</b>. Ambrose, who became the bishop of
the church in the city of Milan (in northern Italy), was born in 339 and died
in 397. He quoted from Mark 16:9-20 several times. In his composition <i class="calibre4">On the
Christian Faith</i>, 1:14, Ambrose quoted from 16:15, and mentioned that he and
his listeners had heard that passage – thus showing that it was in the copies
that were being read aloud in the church services in Milan in the mid-300s. </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Apostolic Constitutions</b>. The composition known as <i class="calibre4">Apostolic
Constitutions</i>, dated c. 380, consists mostly of rewritten extracts from
earlier materials. In the opening sentences of its eighth book, it uses
material from Mark 16:15-18.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Jerome</b>. Jerome produced the Vulgate version of the
Gospels in 383. In his Preface to the Gospels and in his Letter to Marcella,
Jerome affirmed that he had standardized the Old Latin text, which had become a
bramble of textual variations, by conforming it to the text of ancient Greek
MSS (that is, MSS which Jerome considered ancient in 383), where it would otherwise
have a meaning that differed from the meaning of the Greek text. Significantly,
he included Mark 16:9-20 in the Vulgate text of Mark.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Epiphanius of Salamis</b>. Epiphanius was born around
315, became bishop of Salamis (on the island of Cyprus) in 376, and died in
403. In a composition called <i class="calibre4">Panarion</i>, or “Medicine-Chest,” (Book
III:6:3), Epiphanius says to a heretic, “As the Gospel of Mark and the other
evangelists put it, ‘And he ascended up to heaven and sat on the right hand of
the Father.’”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Augustine</b>. In 400, Augustine composed a text called <i class="calibre4">Harmony
of the Gospels</i>. In Book III: 24-25, Augustine quoted all of Mark 16:9-20,
bit by bit. He wrote in Latin, but he mentioned the contents of Greek copies
when writing about 16:12, without giving any indication that there was any
question about the authenticity of the passage.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">The Peshitta</b>. The Peshitta is the standard Syriac
text of most of the New Testament. (It does not include Second Peter, Second
John, Third John, Jude, and Revelation.) Over 350 copies of the Peshitta exist,
including some from the 400s and 500s. Its Gospels-text was produced sometime
in the mid to late 300s. No undamaged copy of the Peshitta lacks Mark 16:9-20.</p>
