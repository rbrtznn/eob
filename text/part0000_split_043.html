<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
Timothy our brother, to the Church of God which is at Corinth, with all the
saints who are throughout Achaia: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Grace to you and peace from God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of mercies and {a} God of all consolation; <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>who
comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who
are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted
by God. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>For as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, even so our
consolation also overflows through Christ. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But if we are afflicted,
it is for your comfort and salvation, which produces in you the patient
enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer, <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>and our hope
for you is unshaken. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and
salvation; knowing that, since you have a share in the sufferings, you also have
a share in the consolation. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>For we do not desire to have you
uninformed, brethren, concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia:
we were extremely oppressed, beyond our power, so much that we even despaired
of life. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Yes, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that
we should not trust in ourselves but [only] in God who raises the dead. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>He
who delivered us from such a great death and continued to deliver—we hope that
he will also deliver us. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>You also help by your supplication on our
behalf, so that thanksgiving will be offered for the gift bestowed on us by
means of many. </p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s relationship with the Corinthians</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Our boasting is this: the testimony of our
conscience. We act in the world in simplicity and sincerity of God (not in
carnal wisdom but in the grace of God), and we do so more abundantly toward you.
<sup class="calibre31">13</sup>We only write what you can read and acknowledge: I hope that you
will accept [those things] even to the end; <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>as you also received
us in part. I also hope that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours,
in the day of the Lord Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>In this confidence, I was determined
to come first to you, so that you might have a double blessing. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>I
would then pass into Macedonia, and then again from Macedonia back to you to be
sent on by you on my journey to Judea. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>After making this plan, did
I waver in my resolve? Or do I plan things in a human way? For with me, “Yes”
should be “yes” and “No,” no. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>But as God is faithful, our word to
you was not “Yes and no.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1835" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1835"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1835]</span></span></span></a>”
<sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Certainly the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
by us—by me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not “Yes and no,” but in him is “Yes.” <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>However
many the promises of God are, in him is the “Yes,” and in him, “Amen,” to the
glory of God, through us.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Now the one who establishes us with you in
Christ and who has anointed us is God. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>He has also sealed us and
given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>I call God as a
witness to my soul, that to spare you I did not come to Corinth. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>It
is not that we have lordship over your faith: we are fellow workers with you
for your joy, as you stand firm in faith.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">But I resolved this for myself: that I would not return to
you in sorrow. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>If I cause you distress, who will bring me joy
except for you, the very ones whom I grieve? <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Indeed, I wrote to you
as I did, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from the ones who should
be my joy; but I trust in you all, that my joy would also be shared by all. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>It
was out of much affliction and anguish of heart that I wrote to you with many
tears, not to cause you distress but to let you know what overflowing love I
have for you. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Still, if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused
sorrow not to me, but to an extent—not to be too severe—to all of you.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1836" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1836"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1836]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">6</sup>For this person, the punishment imposed by the majority [of you]
should be enough. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>In fact, you should rather forgive and comfort
this person,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1837" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1837"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1837]</span></span></span></a>
for fear that he might be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Therefore,
I beg you to confirm your love toward him. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>I had also written with
this purpose: that I might know by a test whether you are obedient in all
things. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Now I also forgive whoever you forgive. Indeed, if I have
forgiven anything, I have forgiven for your sake in the person<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1838" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1838"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1838]</span></span></span></a>
of Christ, <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>so that Satan may not gain any ground over us; and we
are not ignorant of his schemes.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s ministry</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of
Christ as a door was opened to me in the Lord, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>I had no relief for
my spirit, because I did not find Titus, my brother. After taking my leave of
them [in Troas], I headed into Macedonia. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Thanks be to God, who
always leads us in triumph in Christ, and who reveals through us the sweet
fragrance of his knowledge in every place. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Indeed, we are a sweet
fragrance of Christ to God, both in those who are being saved and in those who
are perishing.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1839" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1839"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1839]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">16</sup>To the latter, we are a stench of death to death, but to the first
[we are] a sweet fragrance<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1840" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1840"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1840]</span></span></span></a>
of life to life. Who is equal to such a task? <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>We are not as others
who ‘peddle the word of God,’ but we speak in Christ with sincerity, as from
God and in the sight of God.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The ministry of the Spirit </p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Are we again trying to obtain your approval? Or do we need
(as some do) letters of recommendation to you or from you? <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>You are
our letter, written in our hearts, known<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1841" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1841"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1841]</span></span></span></a>
and read by all! <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>It is being revealed that you are a letter of
Christ, served by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living
God, and not in tablets of stone but in tablets that are hearts of flesh. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>We
have such confidence through Christ toward God; <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>not that we are competent
on our own to claim anything for ourselves; but our competence is from God <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>who
has made us competent as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of
the Spirit. Indeed, the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life! <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>However,
if the ministry of death, written in stones, came with glory, so much that the
children of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his
face (and this glory was passing away): <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>will not the ministry of
the Spirit be with much more glory? <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>For if the ministry of
condemnation has glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds all the more in
glory! <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>It is certain that what used to be glorious has not been
made glorious in such a manner—that is, by such an overwhelming glory. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>For
if what passes away was glorious, how much more glorious is that which remains!</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Since we have such a hope, we use great
boldness of speech, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>not as Moses, who put a veil on his face so
that the children of Israel would not see the end of what was passing away. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>In
this case, their minds were hardened, because to this very day, at the reading
of the old covenant, the same veil remains since only in Christ does it pass
away. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their
heart. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken
away. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Now the Lord is the Spirit<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1842" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1842"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1842]</span></span></span></a>
and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>With
unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are all being
transformed<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1843" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1843"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1843]</span></span></span></a>
into the same image, from glory to glory,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1844" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1844"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1844]</span></span></span></a>
and this is from the Lord, the Spirit.</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_4">4</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Therefore, seeing that we have this ministry, even as we
have obtained mercy, we do not waver. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>We have renounced the hidden
things of shame: we no longer walk in clever lies and we do not handle the word
of God deceitfully. Instead, by the manifestation of the truth, we seek the
approval of everyone who has a conscience in the sight of God. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Even
if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>as
the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe, so
that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ who is the image of God
should not dawn on them. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>For we do not preach [about] ourselves,
but [about] Christ Jesus as Lord, and [we present] ourselves as your
bondservants for the sake of Jesus, <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>seeing that it is God who

of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>However, we have this treasure in vessels of
clay, so that the amazing power may be from God and not from ourselves. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>We
are pressed on every side, yet [we are] not crushed! We are perplexed, but not
to [the point of] despair. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>We are persecuted yet not forsaken;
struck down, yet not destroyed; <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>and we always carry in our bodies
the death of the Lord<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1847" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1847"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1847]</span></span></span></a>
Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Indeed,
we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of
Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>And so, death is at
work in us, but life in you. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Still, we have the same spirit of
faith, according to what is written, “I believed, and therefore I spoke.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1848" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1848"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1848]</span></span></span></a>
We believe, and therefore we also speak; <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>knowing that he who
raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus, and bring us with you into
his presence. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>All these things are for your benefit, so that as
grace is extended to many, this may also cause thanksgiving to be multiplied to
the glory of God. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Therefore, we do not lose heart, but even if
outwardly we are decaying, yet the inner self is being renewed day by day. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Indeed,
the result is that our light affliction (which is temporary) is producing for
us an ever-increasing standing in eternal glory! <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>This is because
we do not look at visible things but at invisible things, and the things which
are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>

we make this our aim: that whether at home or absent, we would be well-pleasing
to him. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of

good or evil. </p>

reasonable, it is for you. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Indeed, the love of Christ overwhelms
us, because we consider this: that if one died for all, then all have died. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>He
died for all, so that those who live should no longer live to themselves but to
him who died and rose again for them. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Therefore, we do not think

<p class="sectiontopic">Concerns for the Corinthians</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Here I am, ready to visit you for the third
time, and I will not be a burden to you. I do not seek your possessions, I seek
you! Is it not the parents who should be saving for their children, not the
children for their parents? <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>I will most gladly spend [for you] and
be spent for your souls, though the more I overflow with love for you, the less
I am loved. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Be that as it may, I did not place a burden on you:
{and some might say that} being crafty, I caught you with deception! <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Or
did I take advantage of you by means of those I sent you? <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>I gave
instructions to Titus and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any
advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the
same steps? <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Again, do you think that we are making an apology to
you? In the sight of God, we speak in Christ. All things, beloved, are to build
you up. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Still, I am afraid that somehow, when I arrive, I might
find you as I would wish, and that I might be found by you not as you would
wish. I am afraid that somehow, there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of
anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots, etc. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>[Yes,
I am afraid] that when I arrive, my God may again humiliate me before you, and
I would mourn for those who have sinned before and not repented of the
impurity, sexual immorality and lustfulness which they have committed.</p>

<p class="chapternumber" id="toc_13">13</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This is the third time I am coming to you! “At the mouth of
two or three witnesses shall every word be established.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1886" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1886"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1886]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">2</sup>As I have said before and now repeat, as I did during my second
visit: now that I am absent, I write to those who have sinned and to all the
rest, if I come again, I will not spare; <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>seeing that you seek a
proof that Christ speaks in me. He is not weak toward you, but powerful in you.
<sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Even though he was crucified in weakness, he lives through the
power of God! We too are weak in him, but we will live with him through the
power of God {which is also} for you. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Test yourselves and see
whether you are in the faith, yes, test your own selves. Do you not know that
Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed, if you are disqualified. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But
I hope that you will realize that we are not disqualified.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>I pray to God that you do not commit anything
evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is honorable
(even if we appear to be disapproved). <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Indeed, we can do nothing
against the truth, only for the truth, <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>and we rejoice when we are
weak and you are strong! We also pray for this; that you would become perfect.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1887" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1887"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1887]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">10</sup>And so, I write these things while absent, so that I may not have
to deal [with you] harshly when I arrive, according to the authority which the
Lord gave me for building up, not for tearing down.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Encouragement</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Finally, brethren, rejoice! Be perfected, be
comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace
will be with you. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Greet one another with a holy kiss! <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>All
the saints greet you. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the
love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with all of you. Amen.</p>
