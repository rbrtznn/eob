        EOB Footnotes
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Unlike the <strong>Orthodox Study Bible (OSB)</strong>, the EOB footnotes focus on textual and translation issues, and refrain from providing extensive theological or doctrinal interpretations. Hence, the goal of the main text is to provide the reader with a clear sense of what the Scriptures say with possible nuances, not how they should be interpreted.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        There are two reasons for this philosophy. The first one is that footnote commentaries are often perceived as “authoritative” by the reader – almost on the level of Scripture or official commentary. Hence, the reader’s attention is directed to particular explanation, at the risk of not letting the inspired text speak for itself. The second reason is that a few of the explanatory footnotes of the OSB may be debated among Orthodox theologians, as in the case of Acts 1:20 and Revelation 17:1 among others. Please refer to the introductions and appendices for appropriate explanations.
