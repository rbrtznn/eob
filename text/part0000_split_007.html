<p class="msonormal1">Unlike the <b class="calibre7">Orthodox Study Bible (OSB)</b>, the EOB
footnotes focus on textual and translation issues, and refrain from providing
extensive theological or doctrinal interpretations. Hence, the goal of the main
text is to provide the reader with a clear sense of what the Scriptures say
with possible nuances, not how they should be interpreted.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre27">There are two reasons for
this philosophy. The first one is that footnote commentaries are often
perceived as “authoritative” by the reader – almost on the level of Scripture
or official commentary. Hence, the reader’s attention is directed to particular
explanation, at the risk of not letting the inspired text speak for itself. The
second reason is that a few of the explanatory footnotes of the OSB may be
debated among Orthodox theologians, as in the case of Acts 1:20 and Revelation
17:1 among others. Please refer to the introductions and appendices for
appropriate explanations.</span></p>
