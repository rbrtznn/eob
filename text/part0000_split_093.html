<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">There is another valid reason for which Orthodox are loath
to concede to an acceptable (or even positive) interpretation of the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>,
and that reason is the great difficulty in reconciling Rome’s insistence that “[the
Father] is the sole origin (<i class="calibre4">arche, aitia</i>) of the <i class="calibre4">ekporevsis</i> of
the Spirit” with the constant affirmation that the Spirit “proceeds by a
communication of the same singular essence by one eternal spiration from the
Father and the Son as from one principle.” Even though the Vulgate translated <i class="calibre4">ekporevomenon
</i>by <i class="calibre4">procedit, </i>the official <i class="calibre4">Clarification</i> explains that in
these affirmations, <i class="calibre4">procedit</i> does not means <i class="calibre4">ekporevsis</i> but <i class="calibre4">proienai</i>,
so that something different than causal origination is being discussed. This is
a very subtle nuance, often lost on the masses. The consistent wording of Latin
theology is as follows:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Father is from no one; the Son is from the
Father only; and the Holy Spirit is from both the Father and the Son equally. <i class="calibre4">The
4th Lateran Council, 1215, A definition against the Albigenses and other
heretics</i></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[We] confess that the Holy Spirit proceeds
eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles, but as from
one; not by two spirations but by one. <i class="calibre4">The 2nd Council of Lyons, 1274,
Constitution on the Procession of the Holy Spirit</i></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Father is not begotten; the Son is begotten
of the Father; the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. <i class="calibre4">The
Council of Florence</i><i class="calibre4">, 1438-45, Decree for the Jacobites</i></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Council of Florence in 1438 explains: “The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father and Son He has his nature and subsistence at once
(simul) from the Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from
one principle and through one spiration … . And, since the Father has
through generation given to the only begotten Son everything that belongs to
the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally from the Father,
from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.” <i class="calibre4">Catechism
of the Catholic Church</i><i class="calibre4">, 246</i></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The confusing and objectionable aspect of these dogmatic
statements is that the Monarchy of the Father as “sole origin (<i class="calibre4">arche, aitia</i>)”
of the Son and Spirit is never mentioned. Roman Catholic theologians assure us
that there is a good reason for this: what is being discussed in those
documents is not ultimate causality (since the issue is settled); it is the
collective or shared dimension of the Spirit’s origin. As St. Maximos
explained, the orthodox <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> is not about the <i class="calibre4">ekporevsis</i> but
the <i class="calibre4">proienai.</i> The Eastern Orthodox concern, as we have seen in John
Zizioulas, is that “the distinction between <span>εκ</span>π<span>ορεύεσθαι</span>
and π<span>ροείναι</span>
was not made in Latin theology, which used the same term, <i class="calibre4">procedere</i>, to
denote both realities.” This is obvious in popular Roman Catholic defenses of
the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>, where the strong affirmation of the unique causality of
the Father is absent and where no mention is made of the difference between <span>εκ</span>π<span>ορεύεσθαι</span>
and π<span>ροείναι</span>.
A typical example is the <i class="calibre4">Catholic Answers</i> tract on the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Scripture reveals that the Spirit proceeds from
the Father and the Son. The external relationships of the persons of the
Trinity mirror their internal relationships. Just as the Father externally sent
the Son into the world in time, the Son internally proceeds from the Father in
the Trinity. Just as the Spirit is externally sent into the world by the Son as
well as the Father (John 15:26, Acts 2:33), he internally proceeds from both Father
and Son in the Trinity. This is why the Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of
the Son (Gal. 4:6) and not just the Spirit of the Father (Matt. 10:20).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">With such a presentation, it not surprising that the
Orthodox reject such a presentation of <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> as confusing and
heretical. On the other hand, the recent high-level clarifications are useful
and constructive.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The Orthodox impression is that historically, “principle” (<i class="calibre4">principium</i>)
was presented as equivalent to <i class="calibre4">aitia</i>, and “proceed” (<i class="calibre4">procedit</i>)
equivalent to <i class="calibre4">ekporevsis</i>. This seems to have been the intent of the
council of Florence, where the Greeks were asked to recognize “the procession
of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son as from one “principium” (arche)
and from one cause (aitia).”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2835" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2835"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2835]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">As a result, the Latin insistence on the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>,
affirming both the ‘single cause’ and the ‘common or collective cause’ seemed
somewhat schizophrenic. It can certainly be admitted that Photios’ simple
‘pyramid scheme,’ which admittedly seems to ignore the unity of Father and Son
in the Spirit, did not lead to such acrobatics of theological nuancing.</p>
