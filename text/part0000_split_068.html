<p class="msonormal1">Based on some statements by early writers such as Irenaeus,
Victorinus, and Eusebius, many commentators have concluded that there is a
patristic consensus on a late dating (96-98) for the book of Revelation. In his
well-received “A second Look at the Second Coming,” Orthodox author T.L.
Frazier wrote that “tradition asserts that the Apostle John wrote Revelation
while he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of Emperor
Domitian, between A.D. 91 and 96.” However, this statement, which is quite
typical, only reflects the view of one stream of tradition on this matter. A
more complete review of the data reveals four different opinions for the
redaction of Revelation.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Saint Epiphanius of Salamis (†403) wrote that “John
prophesied in the time of Claudius (41-54). This view was adopted by two sixth
century Western commentators (Apringius and Beatus of Liebana) who explain that
this view was what “ancient ecclesiastical <i class="calibre4">relatores</i> have taught.” We
should also mention the testimony of Philip Sidetes, a deacon ordained by St.
John Chrysostom who wrote, citing Papias, that John of Zebedee had died quite
early (in context before 58 AD) at the hands of the Jews.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The second position can be called “Early Date” and places
the redaction of Revelation during the reign of Nero (54-68). This tradition is
supported by ancient Syriac sources and adopted by St. Theophilact of Ochrid
who wrote that John was on Patmos “thirty-two years after the Ascension of Christ
into heaven.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The third and most commonly adopted view is that Revelation
was composed during the reign of Domitian (51-96). However, a closer
examination of the sources reveals that Irenaeus’ writings are ambiguous and
that Victorinus has in mind the publication (not necessarily the original
writing) of Revelation under Domitian.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, a few commentators such as St. Dorotheus of Antioch
have suggested that John was exiled under Trajan (98-117) which would be
considered the “Very Late” position.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The position taken in the EOB is that Revelation may have
been written down in Hebrew or Aramaic at a very early date (41-60) and then
widely published in Greek at a later time, close to the end of the first
century. This approach has a significant impact on how one interprets the
prophetic visions, notably the identity of Babylon the Great.</p>
