<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre91">Revelation is a fitting
conclusion to the inspired Holy Scriptures. Genesis is recapitulated and
fulfilled: it is a vision and celebration of the return to paradise and of the
cosmic victory of true and heavenly wisdom manifested in the Word of God as
Wisdom, Word, and Power of God, but also in the Woman clothed with the sun or
in the Tree of life that brings healing, not death.</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The visions vividly illustrate the opposition between what
is divine and true, and what is demonic and counterfeit: Christ vs. Satan or
antichrist, the Bride of the Lamb vs. Babylon the Great (perhaps apostate
Jerusalem), true vs. false Jews, etc.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre27">The opening chapters of
Revelation are reminiscent of the liturgical services of ancient Asia Minor and
of the memory of St. John as “a priest wearing the miter.” It would seem that
“on the Lord’s day,” John experienced an ascent or vision of the reality that
underlies the liturgical symbols of the first Temple and of the early Christian
basilicas: the high priest, the seven-branched lampstand, the <i class="calibre4">synthronon</i>
of the presbyters, incense, etc. Indeed those very elements remain essential to
the liturgical life of Eastern Orthodoxy. Hence, John’s visions are similar to
those of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, and reflect concern for pure and true
worship, not man-made and oriented toward man but according to the heavenly
pattern.</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Revelation is a timeless and encouraging vision of the
restoration and victory of true worship, the bold hope that “to the one who
overcomes, I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame,
and sat down with my Father on his throne” (3:21).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Most commentators fall into one of four groups:</p>

<ul type="square" class="calibre33">
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Preterists</b> interpret Revelation in relation to its
     first-century setting. In this view, most of the events it relates have
     already taken place (mainly in connection with the destruction of
     Jerusalem in 70 AD).</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Historicists</b> interpret Revelation as presenting a
     sequence of events from the time of the apostle to the consummation of
     history. </li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Futurists</b> interpret the visions primarily as
     relevant to the end times and the second coming of Christ.</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Idealists</b> view it as symbolic pictures of such
     timeless truths as the victory of good over evil.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Obviously, these approaches can also be complementary and
help provide a polyvalent interpretation of the various symbols used in the
book.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In the paradigm of high priestly temple worship which is
essential to understand the book, the key is that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent"><span class="calibre8">Beyond the veil,
the hidden place, was eternity in the midst of the creation, and the veil
itself was believed to be a great screen on which history could be seen.</span><a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2409" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2409"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2409]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The great Jewish scholar Philo also understood this
apocalyptic perspective. In his <i class="calibre4">Questions on Exodus</i>, he explained that
“the veil was the boundary between the visible and invisible creation; the
world beyond the veil was unchanging and without transient events, but that the
visible, material world outside the veil was a place of change.” In that sense,
Revelation is a quintessentially Eastern Orthodox book: the Divine Liturgy
assumes the exact same paradigm, which is why we can pray even now:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Remembering, therefore, this command of the
Savior, and all that came to pass for our sake, the cross, the tomb, the
resurrection on the third day, the ascension into heaven, the enthronement at
the right hand of the Father, <i class="calibre4">and the second, glorious coming</i>…</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">For various reasons, the book of Revelation is not part of
the cycle of readings in the Orthodox ecclesiastical lectionary. Certainly,
excesses and heresies connected with erroneous interpretations of this complex
book, especially the thousand-year kingdom, led to greater caution. The
premillennial interpretation promoted by many early Fathers such as Papias,
Justin, and Irenaeus was eventually supplanted with an amillennial perspective.
There are sound historical and biblical reasons for this decision.
Historically, it seems obvious that Apostolic Tradition, for instance the
preaching of Peter and Paul, did not include a teaching on an earthly one
thousand year-long reign of Christ. Millenarism was never embraced in Rome and
Alexandria. On biblical grounds, the binding of Satan is connected with the
ministry of Christ (Luke 10:18; 11:21-22) and Matthew 12:28 associates the
Lord’s exorcisms as evidence that the Kingdom of God had “come upon them.”
Also, Luke 17:20-21 indicates that the coming of the Kingdom of God cannot be
observed and that it is “within you” (cf. Colossians 1:13, John 18:38-39). In
381, the Council of Constantinople relied on Luke 1:33 to affirm that the
Lord’s kingdom would not be limited in time but that it would have “no end.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Taking into account the fact that Revelation is highly
symbolic, especially in its use of numbers, Orthodox interpreters take into
account such texts as 1 Chronicles 16:15 and Psalm 50:10 to see in the image of
a thousand years a metaphor of fullness. Hence, the first resurrection can be
connected with our spiritual death and resurrection in Christ (Romans 6:3-6; Ephesians
2:1, 4-7) which is our entrance into the Kingdom by “water and spirit” (John
3:5). Likewise, the theme of a New Creation and God’s dwelling with his people
(Revelation 20-21) can be connected with the incarnation of the Word and the
new life brought about by baptism (2 Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 6:15;
comparison between Genesis 1 and the accounts of the Lord’s baptism).</p>
