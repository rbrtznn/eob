<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Unlike the Gospel, the book of Revelation or Apocalypse
mentions the name of its author, “John” (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8). However, the exact
identity of this ‘John’ was unspecified, leading to occasional speculations
that the author was another John (i.e. “the presbyter John”) but not the
apostle and beloved disciple. Already in the mid-third century, St. Dionysius
of Alexandria could write:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Some before us have set aside and rejected the
book altogether, criticizing it chapter by chapter, pronouncing it without
sense or argument, and maintaining that the title is fraudulent. They say that
it is not the work of John or a ‘revelation,’ because it is covered thickly and
densely by a veil of obscurity. [They affirm that its author is Cerinthus, who,
desiring a reputable authority for his fiction, prefixed the name…] However,
I could not venture to reject the book, as many brethren hold it in high
esteem. But I suppose that it is beyond my comprehension, and that there is a
certain concealed and more wonderful meaning in every part. Indeed, if I do not
understand, I suspect that a deeper sense lies beneath the words. I do not
measure and judge them by my own reason… I do not reject what I cannot
comprehend, but rather wonder because I do not understand it.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Therefore that the author was called John, and
that this book is the work of one John, I do not deny. And I agree also that it
is the work of a holy and inspired man. But I cannot readily admit that he was
the apostle, the son of Zebedee, the brother of James, by whom the Gospel of
John and the Catholic Epistle were written. For I judge from the character of
both and the forms of expression, as well as the entire execution of the book,
that it is not his. For the evangelist nowhere gives his name, or proclaims
himself, either in the Gospel or Epistle… In fact, he did not say, as often in
the Gospel, that he was the beloved disciple of the Lord, or the one who lay on
his breast, or the brother of James, or the eyewitness and hearer of the Lord.
Certainly he would have spoken of these things if he had wished to reveal
himself plainly. However, he says none of them; but speaks of himself as our
brother and companion, and a witness of Jesus, and blessed because he had seen
and heard the revelations. So, I am of the opinion that there were many with
the same name as the apostle John, who, on account of their love for him, and
because they admired and emulated him, and desired to be loved by the Lord as
he was, took to themselves the same surname, as many of the children of the
faithful are called Paul or Peter. For example, there is also another John,
surnamed Mark, mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles… But that it is he who
wrote this, I would not say… I think that he was some other one of those in
Asia; as they say that there are two monuments in Ephesus, each bearing the
name of John.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2406" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2406"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2406]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Citing Papias, Eusebius also expresses the possibility that
Revelation may have been the work of a close disciple of the apostles, a man
also called ‘John:’</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The name John is twice enumerated by [Papias]. The
first one he mentions in connection with Peter and James and Matthew and the
rest of the apostles, clearly meaning the evangelist; but the other John he
mentions after an interval, and places him among others outside of the number
of the apostles, putting Aristion before him, and he distinctly calls him a
presbyter. This shows that the statement of those is true, who say that there
were two persons in Asia that bore the same name, and that there were two tombs
in Ephesus, each of which, even to the present day is called John’s. It is
important to notice this. For it is probable that it was the second, if one is
not willing to admit that it was the first that saw the Revelation, which is
ascribed by name to John.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2407" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2407"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2407]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This being said, the wider Orthodox tradition has
consistently affirmed the direct connection between John of Zebedee and what is
known today as the Johannine corpus. Indeed, the high priestly theme and
paradigm discussed in relation to the Gospel is also paramount in the book of
Revelation, as its very name (<i class="calibre4">apokalypsis</i> means “lifting of the veil”)
indicates. There are also unique expressions and concerns (Word of God,
relationship with the Jews) that are unique to the Johannine corpus. Hence, it
is probable that John worked with different secretaries or collaborators
(tradition has St. Prochoros in the case of Revelation) and that the
circumstances affecting the redaction of these works may have been drastically
different. The book of Revelation may also have been written in Aramaic (or
Hebrew) and later on translated in ‘rough Greek.’</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Revelation itself is often dated to 96-98 AD, but is also
possible that it is an earlier work or that it includes material going back as
far as 50-70 AD, or even from the lifetime of Jesus Christ (1:1).</p>
