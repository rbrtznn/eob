<p class="msonormal1">The translation of the New Testament included in the EOB is
based on the official Greek text published by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of
Constantinople in 1904 (<b class="calibre7">Patriarchal Text or PT</b>). During the Turkish
occupation of the Greek lands, various editions of the NT had been published
with significant variants. In 1902, in order to ensure ecclesiastical harmony,
the Ecumenical Patriarchate appointed a committee whose task was to publish a
common and official text. This committee studied about 20 major Byzantine
manuscripts from which they adopted one as starting point, yet taking into
consideration significant variants from other manuscripts. This text, which is
very close to the so-called <b class="calibre7">Majority Text</b> (MT), was published for the
first time in 1904. It has since then been adopted by all Greek-speaking
Orthodox Churches (Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Greece, Cyprus, and
Crete). Its purpose is not to offer an always speculative reconstruction of the
original autographs but to provide <b class="calibre7">a uniform ecclesiastical text</b> which
is a reliable and accurate witness to the truth of the Christian faith.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<div class="calibre29">

<p class="boxparcxspfirst"><span class="calibre27">The <b class="calibre7">Patriarchal Text</b> (sometimes coded as </span><span class="calibre27">Pt</span><span class="calibre27">) is also known as the “Antoniades Greek New
Testament” after Basil Antoniades who was the leading scholar involved in the
preparation of the text. In the process, he consulted a number of manuscripts,
mostly representing the Byzantine Constantinopolitan tradition, but also other
text-types. There are 63 Gospel manuscripts, 30 praxapostoloi and 24
manuscripts of the book of Revelation.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn2" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[2]</span></span></span></a>
In terms of method, Antoniades opted to follow St John Chrysostom whenever
variants existed among the manuscripts consulted. In his <i class="calibre4">Introduction</i>
(1904), he explains:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal7">“According
to the lectionaries testimony of sixty or more MSS of the fuller Gospel
lectionaries which were collated for us in Athens and Jerusalem, or elsewhere
for other purposes and were accessible to us, both of these types belong to the
Church of Constantinople and were in public and official use, at least from the
ninth century to the sixteenth. Yet each type was preserved so carefully and
distinctly that, notwithstanding the length of period, only a few copies (and
only in a few respects) show any variation or mutual contamination of type;
and, most important of all, when one has studied a few copies of one type he
has little to learn from the remaining copies of that type.”</p>

<p class="msonormal7">“This
established continuity for at least eight centuries in one and the same diocese
and the preservation practically intact of two types of Gospel text is, in our
opinion, most simply explained on the assumption that both types were even
earlier in public and official use, possessing the authority of antiquity and
authenticity. The type more nearly approaching the Byzantine appears to be the
same as the Antiochan, or Syrian recension disseminated in the Church of
Constantinople in the time of the holy Chrysostom and since.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre27"> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre27">This Greek text was
prepared more than a hundred years ago, hence before the discovery of several
very ancient manuscripts and before the development of textual criticism. For
this reason, even though the Patriarchal text is primary for the main body of
the EOB/NT, constant reference has been made to the so-called <b class="calibre7">Critical Text</b>
(CT) published by the United Bible Society (UBS/NA27 4<sup class="calibre31">th</sup> edition).
In the process of comparing the differences between the Patriarchal Text and
the Critical Text, special attention has been given to <b class="calibre7">patristic quotations</b>.
All significant variants between PT/MT/TR and CT have been studied and
footnoted to provide variant readings.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre27"> </span></p>

<div class="calibre32">

<p class="boxparcxspfirst">The <b class="calibre7">Byzantine
text-type</b> (also called Majority, Traditional, Ecclesiastical, Constantinopolitan,
or Syrian) is one of several text-types used in textual criticism to describe
the textual character of certain Greek New Testament manuscripts. It is the
form found in the largest number of surviving manuscripts. </p>

<p class="boxparcxspmiddle"><br class="calibre6"/>
The New Testament text of the Greek Orthodox Churches, the Patriarchal edition
of 1904 (PT), is based on this text-type. This textual tradition also underlies
the Textus Receptus Greek text.</p>

<p class="boxparcxspmiddle"><br class="calibre6"/>
A synthetic Greek New Testament text based on these majority readings – hence
the name “Majority Text” – has been produced by Zane C. Hodges and Arthur L.
Farstad, although this text does not correspond to any one particular
manuscript.</p>

<p class="boxparcxsplast"><br class="calibre6"/>
There are only six manuscripts earlier than the 9th century which conform to
the Byzantine text-type; of which the 5th century Codex Alexandrinus, (the
oldest), is Byzantine only in the Gospels with the rest of the New Testament
being Alexandrian. By comparison, the Alexandrian text-type is witnessed by
nine surviving uncials earlier than the ninth century (including the Codex
Alexandrinus outside the Gospels); and is also usually considered to be
demonstrated in three earlier papyri. Modern critical editions of the New
Testament tend to conform most often to Alexandrian witnesses – especially
Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus (see below). The earliest of the Church
Fathers who is considered to be a consistent witness to a Byzantine text-type
in NT quotations is St. John Chrysostom.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Orthodox Christians should be aware that the foundational
Greek text used by most modern translations such as the <b class="calibre7">New International
Version</b> and (New) <b class="calibre7">Revised Standard Version</b> is the <b class="calibre7">Critical Text</b>
(CT). By contrast, the foundational text for the King James and New King James
versions is the <b class="calibre7">Textus Receptus</b> (TR). Moreover, many use the <b class="calibre7">dynamic-equivalency</b>
translation approach as opposed to <b class="calibre7">formal-equivalency</b>. Due to doctrinal
bias and other aberrations, these translations are generally prohibited for
ecclesiastical use by Orthodox hierarchs.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The EOB/NT was translated using the formal-equivalency
approach, although like the King James Version, it sometimes adopts
dynamic-equivalent readings. Also, and for the purpose of easier readability
and comprehension, long Greek sentences have been broken down into smaller
units, yet without significant alterations of the intended meaning or of the
original word-flow.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn3" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref3"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
