JEROMIAN VIEW</a></h2>

<p class="msonormal1">The theory proposed by St. Jerome is that the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i>
of the Lord were most probably cousins, and that both Mary and Joseph were
always virgins. The nexus of the Jeromian view is to identify the “other Mary”
of the synoptics as well as her son “James.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This enigmatic figure must have been a close disciple of the
Lord since she is mentioned so frequently: at the foot of the Cross of
Crucifixion of our Lord, at His Tomb, and in the Upper Room. She is also
identified as the mother of a certain James (James being a very common name).
In Matthew 27:56 she is at the Cross, called “Mary, the mother of James and
Joseph.” In verse 61, at the Tomb, she is called “the other Mary.” In Matthew
28:1, she is going to the Tomb and referred to as “the other Mary;” and in Mark
15:40 as “Mary, the mother of James the younger and of Joses.” Again, in verse
47, we have “Mary the mother of Joses” and in Mark 16:1, going to the Tomb with
spices, she is called “Mary the mother of James.” </p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the Gospel of Luke, she is mentioned in 24:10, speaking
to the Apostles about the Resurrection, as “Mary the mother of James.” Finally,
John 19:25 reads: “So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus
were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
Magdalene.” </p>

<p class="msonormal1">These texts are actually quite ambiguous on at least three
points: (1) Is “Mary of Clopas” the same as “his mother’s sister” in John 19:2?
This is very probable based on the construction but not absolutely certain. (2)
Does “sister” mean “biological” sister? This is very unlikely because parents
would not give the same first name to two of their children! Hence, “sister”
could mean close relative or sister in law, as we shall see. (3) Was “Mary of
Clopas” the wife or daughter of the man named Clopas (<span>Klwpa/</span>)?</p>

<p class="msonormal1">At this point, we must ask ourselves if we are willing to go
outside the Scriptural data and consider Early Christian traditions to help us
elucidate the situation. If so, the testimony of Hegesippus (+180, quoted in
Eusebius) is very helpful:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">After the martyrdom of James and the conquest of
Jerusalem which immediately followed, it is said that those of the apostles and
disciples of the Lord that were still living came together from all directions
with those that were related to the Lord according to the flesh (for the
majority of them also were still alive) to take counsel as to who was worthy to
succeed James. They all with one consent pronounced Symeon, the son of Clopas,
of whom the Gospel also makes mention; to be worthy of the episcopal throne of
that parish. He was a cousin, as they say, of the Savior. For Hegesippus
records that Clopas was a brother of Joseph.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2888" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2888"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2888]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Pr. Bauckham uses this information to shed further light on
these relatives of the Lord:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">According to Hegesippus, Joseph had a brother
named Clopas. The name is extremely rare: only two other certain occurrences of
it are known. One of these is in John 19:25. We can therefore be sure that the
man to whom this verse of the Fourth Gospel refers is the same Clopas, Joseph’s
brother. If ‘Mary of Clopas’ was Clopas’s wife, then she was in fact Jesus’
mother’s husband’s brother’s wife—a relationship which, not surprisingly, the
evangelist has preferred to state less precisely as: ‘his mother’s sister’. So
it seems that an aunt of Jesus, as well as his mother, was among those Galilean
women who accompanied him on his last journey to Jerusalem and were present at
the cross.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Probably Clopas himself was also in Jerusalem at
this time. Luke names one of the two disciples in his story of the walk to
Emmaus as Cleopas (Lk. 24:18). This Greek name is not the same as the Semitic
name Clopas, but it was common for Palestinian Jews at this period to be known
by both a Semitic name and a Greek name which sounded similar (Simon/Simeon).
Luke names him because he was a sufficiently significant person in the early
church for some of Luke’s readers to have heard of him. Perhaps his companion
on the road to Emmaus was his wife Mary. This uncle and this aunt of Jesus were
among his loyal followers at the end of his ministry.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2889" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2889"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2889]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">We can therefore conclude that Mary of Clopas was a relative
of the mother of Jesus, and the “mother of James the Less and Joses” where “the
Less” (<span>tou/ mikrou</span>) can also
be translated “the Younger/the Least/the Smallest.” What is significant is that
“James and Joses” are counted among the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> of the Lord in Mark
6:3. These were common names, but it is very possible that these
‘brothers/relatives’ of Jesus mentioned in Mark 6:3 were in fact sons of Mary
of Clopas who may well have been Joseph’s sister-in-law. This identification
would go against the Epiphanian/Greek view which sees James ‘the Lord’s
brother’ as a son of Joseph but both approaches are compatible: James the Just
and “of Jerusalem” (one of the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i>) could have been Jesus’
step-brother through Joseph and James the Less (brother of Joses/Joseph) could
be a different James, i.e. a son of Clopas who would be Joseph’s brother.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">It should also be noted that some have suggested that in
Mark 15:40, “Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses” (also in Matthew
27:56) was in fact the mother of Jesus, but this seems close to impossible.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">What remains extremely complex is the identification of
“James” in various passages.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Before discussing this issue at length, the <i class="calibre4">Catholic
Encyclopedia</i> reminds the reader of who is called ‘James’ in the New
Testament:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">(1) James, the son of Zebedee — Apostle,
brother of John, Apostle; also called “James the Greater”. </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">(2) James, the son of Alphaeus, Apostle —
Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13. </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">(3) James, the brother of the Lord — Matthew
13:55; Mark 6:3; Galatians 1:19. Without a shadow of doubt, he must be
identified with the James of Galatians 2:2 and 2:9; Acts 12:17, 15:13; 21:18;
and 1 Corinthians 15:7. </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">(4) James, the son of Mary, brother of Joseph
(or Joses) — Mark 15:40 (where he is called ò mikros “the little”,
not the “less”, as in the D.V., nor the “lesser”); Matthew
27:56. Probably the son of Cleophas or Clopas (John 19:25) where “Maria
Cleophæ” is generally translated “Mary the wife of Cleophas”, as
married women are commonly distinguished by the addition of their husband’s
name. </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">(5) James, the brother of Jude — Jude 1:1. Most
Catholic commentators identify Jude with the “Judas Jacobi”, the
“brother of James” (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13), called thus because his
brother James was better known than himself in the primitive Church.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The article continues with a discussion of the possible
identification of the Apostle James (2), the son of Alphaeus and James (3), the
brother of the Lord and Bishop of the Church of Jerusalem (Acts 15, 21) which
is favored in the Roman Catholic view but which was never embraced in the East:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The identity of the Apostle James (2) and James
(3), although contested by many critics and, perhaps, not quite beyond doubt,
is at least most highly probable, and by far the greater number of Catholic
interpreters is considered as certain (where the chief argument, taken from
Galatians 1:19, in favor of the Apostleship of St. James the brother of the
Lord, is to be found). The objection moved by some against the common statement
that “Apostles” in Galatians 1:19<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2890" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2890"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2890]</span></span></span></a>
is to be taken strictly in the sense of the “Twelve” has been strongly
[debated]. The James (5) of Jude 1:1 must certainly be identified with James
(3), the brother of the Lord and the Bishop of Jerusalem. The identification of
James (3), the brother of the Lord and James (4), the son of Mary, and probably
of Cleophas or Clopas offers some difficulty. <span class="calibre34">This identification requires
the identity of Mary, the mother of James (Matthew 27:56; Mark 15:40), with
Mary the wife of Cleophas (John 19:25), and, consequently, the identity of
Alphaeus (2) and Clopas (4)</span>. As Clopas and Alphaeus are probably not two
different transcriptions of the same Aramaic name Halpai, it must be admitted
that two different names have been borne by one man. Indeed, there are several
examples of the use of two names (a Hebrew and a Greek or Latin name) to
designate the same person (Simon-Petrus; Saulus-Paulus), so that the identity
of Alphaeus and Cleophas is by no means improbable.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2891" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2891"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2891]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">On the whole, although there is no full evidence
for the identity of James (2), the son of Alphaeus, and James (3), the brother
of the Lord, and James (4), the son of Mary of Clopas, the view that one and
the same person is described in the New Testament in these three different
ways, is by far the most probable. There is, at any rate, very good ground
(Galatians 1:19, 2:9, 2:12) for believing that the Apostle James, the son of
Alphaeus is the same person as James, the brother of the Lord, the well-known
Bishop of Jerusalem of the Acts.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Some aspects of this theory are possible and since St.
Jerome is undoubtedly a saint of East and West, his view may be considered to
belong to the wider heritage of Orthodox Christianity. This being said, the
view that James of Jerusalem was a son of Joseph (prior to his becoming a
widower) is on traditional grounds the one that is to be considered normative
in Eastern Orthodoxy.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This being said, there remains a hesitation to offer a
dogmatic interpretation of this data, as illustrated by the entry for “James
the Apostle, Brother of Our Lord” published by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese
of America:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">According to some, this Saint was a son of
Joseph the Betrothed, born of the wife that the latter had before he was betrothed
to the Ever-virgin. Hence he was the brother of the Lord, Who was also thought
to be the son of Joseph (Matt. 13: 55). But some say that he was a nephew of
Joseph, and the son of his brother Cleopas, who was also called Alphaeus and
Mary his wife, who was the first cousin of the Theotokos. But even according to
this genealogy, he was still called, according to the idiom of the Scriptures,
the Lord’s brother because of their kinship.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">This James is called the Less (Mark 15:4) by the
Evangelists to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee, who was called
the Great. He became the first Bishop of Jerusalem, elevated to this episcopal
rank by the Apostles, according to Eusebius…</p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, we have seen that the ideas that ‘Cleopas was also
called Alphaeus and that Mary his wife, was the first cousin of the Theotokos’
are extremely speculative. Also, by stating that “This James is called the Less
(Mark 15:4) by the Evangelists to distinguish him from James, the son of
Zebedee,” one gains the impression that James of Jerusalem was possibly one of
the Twelve, whereas the primary Orthodox tradition favors the view that he was
an apostle of the Seventy.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The preferred view of this article is that not every one of
the Lord’s relatives failed to believe in him. As we have seen, while Joseph
had already gone to his rest, his brother Clopas/Cleopas and sister-in law
(Clopas’ wife Mary) were well-known disciples of Christ. One of Clopas’ sons,
Symeon, later became the second bishop of Jerusalem after James; and this Symeon
(or Symon) may be the one mentioned as an adelphos in Mark 6:3. It may also be
suggested that Clopas should not in fact be identified with Alphaeus, which
means that “James of Alphaeus” (one of the Twelve) should not be confused with
James the son of Mary of Clopas.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2892" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2892"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2892]</span></span></span></a>
Regarding the identification of James of Jerusalem and the Apostle James of
Alphaeus, it would seem preferable to maintain the traditional Orthodox view
that these are two different men. In doing so, we must concede that Galatians
1:19 is a difficult text since it seems to place “James the Lord’s brother”
among the apostles. However, it is likely that James was in fact among the
Seventy (as attested in the Slavic tradition) and that the Twelve apostles did
not see it fitting that any of them should become bishop of a particular city.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, it seems clear that among “his brothers James and
Joseph/Joses and Simon and Judas,” the first three are most probably sons of
Mary of Clopas and therefore ‘step cousins’ of Jesus. If Mary and Jesus had
been ‘adopted’ in Joseph’s clan, they could indeed have been called <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i>
in a Jewish/Aramaic context. However, it may also be that the James of Mark 6:3
was a son of Joseph and the future bishop of Jerusalem if we adopt the view
that this James is not identical with the James the Less/Younger of Mark 15:40.</p>
