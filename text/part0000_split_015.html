<p class="msonormal1">It is normative to translate the Greek expression <span>basilei,a tou/ qeou/</span> as “Kingdom of
God,” although some scholars have also noted that such a translation is
problematic. The late Fr. John Romanides insisted that:</p>

<p class="msoquote">Another example is the phrase “kingdom of God”
which makes it a creation of God instead of the uncreated ruling power of God.
What is amazing is that the term “kingdom of God” appears not once in
the original Greek of the New Testament. Not knowing that the “rule”
or “reign of God” is the correct translation of the Greek
“Basileia tou Theou,” [many] do not see that the promise of Christ to
his apostles in Mt.16:28, Lk. 9:27 and Mk. 9:1, i.e. that they will see God’s
ruling power, was fulfilled during the Transfiguration which immediately
follows in the above three Gospels. Here Peter, James and John see Christ as
the Lord of Glory i.e. as the source of God’s uncreated “glory” and
“basileia” i.e. uncreated ruling power, denoted by the uncreated
cloud or glory which appeared and covered the three of them during the Lord of
Glory’s Transfiguration. It was by means of His power of Glory that Christ, as
the pre-incarnate Lord (Yahweh) of Glory, had delivered Israel from its
Egyptian slavery and led it to freedom and the land of promise. The Greek text
does not speak about the “Basileion (kingdom) of God,” but about the
“Basileia (rule or reign) of God,” by means of His uncreated glory
and power.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn20" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref20"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[20]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">For this reason, the YLT proposes “reign” as the most
accurate translation, and a few translations occasionally render <span>basilei,a</span> as “reign” (NJB Luke
1:33). After due consideration, the EOB consistently maintains the usual
translation (“Kingdom”) but the reader should be aware of this option and that
“reign” or “rule” may be more accurate translations.</p>
