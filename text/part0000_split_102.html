<p class="msonormal1">In addition to the historic-textual data discussed above,
the fact that the inspired Scriptures present the Theotokos as the antitype of
the holy dwelling place of God, especially the Ark is significant. This
typology, presented in the introductory section of the EOB, is unmistakable and
precludes the idea that any human hand would have touched the Ark of God, both
in type and fulfillment.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2878" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2878"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2878]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">When the issue of the perpetual virginity of the Theotokos
came under discussion, some of the Fathers, notably St. Ambrose and St.
Augustine, also pointed to Ezekiel’s vision:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the
sanctuary, which faces east; and it was shut. The Lord said to me: This gate
shall remain shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it; for
the Lord, the God of Israel, has entered by it; therefore it shall remain shut.
Only the prince, because he is a prince, may sit in it to eat food before the
Lord; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and shall go out by
the same way. Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the
temple; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the temple of
the Lord; and I fell upon my face.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2879" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2879"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2879]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">As heirs of ancient Israel, princes and seers of the glory
of the Kingdom, Orthodox Christians honor the Mother of the King with same
reverence which the Davidic princes accorded to their mother:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The queen stood by on thy right hand, vested in
gold and arrayed in embroidery.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2880" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2880"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2880]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">LXE (Brenton LXX) 1 Kings 2:13 And Adonias the
son of Aggith came in to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, and did obeisance<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2881" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2881"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2881]</span></span></span></a>
to her: and she said, Dost thou enter peaceably? and he said, Peaceably…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">LXE 1 (Brenton LXX) Kings 2:19 And Bersabee went
in to king Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonias; and the king rose up to
meet her, and kissed her, and sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the
mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, the place of the Spirit, “the household of God, which
is the Church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth” reads
such Old Testament passages on the feasts of the Mother of the Savior who is
called ‘our Lord and our God’ (John 20:28).</p>
