JOHN 1:1 and 18—JESUS AS “GOD</a>”</h1>

<h2 class="section-heading"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418877"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418753"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418605">JOHN 1:1—THE WORD WAS {WHAT} GOD {WAS}</a></h2>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Although the majority of modern translations render John
1:1c as “and the Word was God,” this translation is somewhat problematic and
possibly misleading. As one of the leading scholars on this issue admits:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[It] is clear that in the translation “the Word
was God,” the term <i class="calibre4">God</i> is being used to denote his nature or essence,
and not his person. But in normal English usage “God” is a proper noun,
referring to the person of the Father or corporately to the three persons of
the Godhead. Moreover, “the Word was God” suggests that “the Word” and “God”
are convertible terms, that the proposition is reciprocating. But the Word is
neither the Father nor the Trinity… The rendering cannot stand without
explanation. (Murray Harris—<i class="calibre4">Jesus as God</i>, p. 69)</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In the words of a non-Trinitarian critic of this
translation, “Trinitarians do not mean what they say and they do not say what
they mean.” Moreover, qualified Greek scholars such as Jason BeDuhn have also
taken a public stand against the traditional translation, going as far as to
state that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Grammatically, John 1:1 is not a difficult verse
to translate. It follows familiar, ordinary structures of Greek expression. A
lexical (“interlinear”) translation of the controversial clause would read: “And
a god was the Word.” A minimal literal (“formal equivalence”) translation would
rearrange the word order to match proper English expression: “And the Word was
a god.” The preponderance of evidence, from Greek grammar, from literary
context, and from cultural environment, supports this translation, of which “the
Word was divine” would be a slightly more polished variant carrying the same
basic meaning. Both of these renderings are superior to the traditional
translation which goes against these three key factors that guide accurate
translation. The NASB, NIV, NRSV, and NAB follow the translation concocted by
the KJV translators. This translation awaits a proper defense, since no obvious
one emerges from Greek grammar, the literary context of John, or the cultural
environment in which John is writing… (Jason BeDuhn, <i class="calibre4">Truth in translation</i>)</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This concern has been taken seriously and a number of
alternative translations have been proposed and used in recent versions,
including:</p>

<p class="bulletlist">(1)<span class="calibre61">      </span>The
Word was a god or The Word was god (Jannaris, Becker, DeBuhn)</p>

<p class="bulletlist">(2)<span class="calibre61">     </span>The Word
was divine (Moffatt, Goodspeed, Schonfield, Temple, Strachan, Zerwick)</p>

<p class="bulletlist">(3)<span class="calibre61">      </span>The
Word was deity (Dana and Mantey, Perry, Tenney, Fennema)</p>

<p class="bulletlist">(4)<span class="calibre61">     </span>What God
was, the Word was (NEB, REB).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The EOB footnote for this verse explains the difficulty: </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Greek word Logos (<span>lo,goj</span>) is traditionally translated as “Word.” French
translations sometimes use “Verb” which has a dynamic quality. The English
“Message” or “Expression of the Mind” may also be appropriate attempts to
convey the nuance of the Greek concept. The Jewish-Alexandrian theologian and
philosopher Philo wrote extensively about the Logos in ways that are
reminiscent of NT theology. For instance, his teaching that “For the Logos of
the living God being the bond of every thing, as has been said before, holds
all things together, and binds all the parts, and prevents them from being
loosened or separated” echoes Colossians 1:17.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In order to allow the public reader to use the now
traditional form “The Word was God,” the EOB uses parentheses to inform the
private reader that the second <i class="calibre4">theos</i> should be understood in a
qualitative, not personal sense. The liturgical reader also has the option to
read the verse as “the Word was what God was” which is indeed a very accurate
translation of the grammar and intent of the Greek text.</p>
