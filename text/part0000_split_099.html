<p class="msonormal1">From an Eastern Orthodox perspective, it is important to
understand that the Orthodox Faith does not include Marian dogmas as such: even
the dogmatic title ‘Theotokos’ belongs to the realm of Christology, not
‘Mariology;’ it is a soteriological dogma about the nature of Christ, not about
his mother. The same can said about the belief in the Dormition/Assumption of
the Virgin Mary which is a dogma in Roman Catholicism<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2855" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2855"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2855]</span></span></span></a>
but not in Eastern Orthodoxy. Within an Eastern Orthodox context, these should
be considered as “ecclesial convictions:” the Church is convinced that these
things are true (that she remained ever-virgin and that “in giving birth, you
preserved your virginity. In falling asleep you did not forsake the world, O
Theotokos. You were translated to life, 0 Mother of Life”),<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2856" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2856"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2856]</span></span></span></a>
but these truths, although precious, do not belong to the essence of the Gospel.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2857" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2857"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2857]</span></span></span></a>
Hence, every Orthodox liturgical service includes several references to “our
most holy, pure, blessed, and glorious Lady, the Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary.”
This confident conviction is also expressed in canon 2 of the Fifth Ecumenical
Council at Constantinople in 553:<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2858" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2858"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2858]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">If anyone does not confess that there were two
nativities of the Word of God, one before the ages… the other in the last
days… who came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the holy, glorious ever
virgin Mother of God Mary, and was born of her, let him be anathema.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, St. Basil, who was himself (as all Orthodox should
be), a believer in the perpetual virginity of the Theotokos, could still write
that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[The opinion that Mary bore several children
after Christ] … is not against the faith; for virginity was imposed on Mary
as a necessity only up to the time that she served as an instrument for the
Incarnation. On the other hand, her subsequent virginity was not essential to
the mystery of the Incarnation. (<i class="calibre4">Homilia</i> <i class="calibre4">in</i> <i class="calibre4">sanctam</i> <i class="calibre4">Christi</i>
<i class="calibre4">generationem</i>, PG 31:1468)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Nevertheless, the same text<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2859" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2859"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2859]</span></span></span></a>
also contains the following admonition:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The friends of Christ do not tolerate hearing
that the Theotokos ever ceased to be a virgin… (§5)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This Orthodox position is consistent with the exegesis and
teachings of Origen, St. Gregory of Nyssa<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2860" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2860"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2860]</span></span></span></a>
and St. John Chrysostom among others. Commenting on the Gospel of Matthew, the
great preacher noted:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">When Joseph had taken Mary [as wife], he did not
know her until she had brought forth her first-born Son. Here, [Matthew] used
the word until, not that you should suspect that afterwards he did know her,
but to inform you that before the birth, the Virgin was wholly untouched by
man. But why then, it may be said, did he use the word until? Because it is
usual in Scripture to do this and to use this expression without reference to
limited times… Here, likewise, it uses the word until to make certain what was
before the birth, but as to what follows, it leaves you to make the inference.
Thus, what it was necessary for you to learn of Him, this he said; that the
Virgin was untouched by man until the birth; but that which both was seen to be
a consequence of the former statement, and was acknowledged, this in its turn
he leaves for you to perceive; namely, that not even after this, she having so
become a mother, and having been counted worthy of a new sort of travail, and a
child-bearing so strange, could that righteous man ever have endured to know
her. For if he had known her, and had kept her in the place of a wife, how is
it that our Lord commits her, as unprotected, and having no one, to His
disciple, and commands him to take her to his own home? (St. John Chrysostom, <i class="calibre4">On
the Gospel of Matthew,</i> V.5)</p>
