<p class="sectiontopic">A different “Good News”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting
the one who called you in the grace of Christ in order to embrace a different
“Good News”—<sup class="calibre31">7</sup>and there is no other “Good News!” Yet, there are some
who disturb you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Now
even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “Good News” that
is not what we preached to you, let such a one be accursed!<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1888" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1888"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1888]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">9</sup>We have said it before and now I say it again: if anyone preaches
to you any other “Good News” than what you received, let such a one be
accursed! <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Am I now seeking to please God or people? Am I striving
to please human beings? But if I were still trying to please men, then I would
not be a bondservant of Christ!</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s account</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre27">11</span></sup><span class="calibre27">[Regarding] the Good News which I preached, I
proclaimed this to you, brethren, that it is not of human origin. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>I
did not receive it from man and I was not taught [this Good News] by man, but
it came to me through a revelation of Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>You have heard
about how I used to live in Judaism, how I persecuted the Church of God beyond
measure, and how I ravaged it. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>I advanced in the Jewish religion
beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, as I was more extremely zealous
for the traditions of my forefathers. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>But when it was the good
pleasure of God (who had set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me
through his grace, <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach
him among the Gentiles), I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood: <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>I
did not go up to Jerusalem to visit those who were apostles before me, but I
went away into Arabia. Later on, I returned to Damascus. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Then,
after three years, I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I stayed with
him for fifteen days. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>However, I did not see any of the other
apostles,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1889" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1889"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[1889]</span></span></span></a>

<sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Now regarding the things which I write to you, you can see that I
am not lying before God. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>After that, I visited the districts of
Syria and Cilicia. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>My face was still unknown to the Churches of
Judea which were in Christ; <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>they only heard, “The one who once
persecuted us is now preaching the faith that he once tried to destroy!” <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>And
they glorified God in me.</span>                              </p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Fourteen years later, I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas, and Titus accompanied me. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>I went up by revelation and I
presented to them<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1891" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1891"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1891]</span></span></span></a>
the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles. I did so in private in front
of those who were recognized leaders, for fear that I might be running—or had
been running—in vain. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>But even though Titus (who was with me) was a
Greek, he was not compelled to be circumcised. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>This occurred
because false brethren were secretly brought in, who sneaked in to spy out the
freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into
slavery. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>But we did not give in to them,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1892" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1892"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1892]</span></span></span></a>
not even for an hour, so that the truth of the Good News might continue with
you. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>As far as the recognized leaders were concerned (what they
were<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1893" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1893"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1893]</span></span></span></a>
{before} makes no difference to me; God does not discriminate), I can say that
those who were respected added nothing to me. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Instead, when they
saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised, just as
Peter [had been entrusted] with the Good News for those who are circumcised <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>(since
he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision also appointed me
to the Gentiles); <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>and when James, Kephas<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1894" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1894"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1894]</span></span></span></a>,
and John, who were considered as pillars, perceived the grace that was given to
me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, [showing] that
we should go to the Gentiles, and they to those who are circumcised. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>They
only asked us to remember the poor<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1895" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1895"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1895]</span></span></span></a>—which
is the very thing that I was eager to do.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul confronts Kephas (Peter) in Antioch</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>However, when Peter<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1896" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1896"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1896]</span></span></span></a>
came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Before
some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they
arrived, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the
circumcision! <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Moreover, the rest of the Jews joined him in his
hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy! <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>When
I saw that their behavior was not consistent with the truth of the Gospel,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1897" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1897"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1897]</span></span></span></a>
I said to Peter before them all, “If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do,
and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Faith and the works of the law</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>As for us, being Jews by nature and not Gentile
sinners, <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>yet knowing that no one is justified by the works of the
law but through faith in Jesus Christ<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1898" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1898"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1898]</span></span></span></a>,
we believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ,
and not by the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works
of the law. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>But if, even though we desired to be justified in
Christ, we were found to be sinners, does that mean that Christ is a servant of
sin? Certainly not! <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Indeed, if I build up again those things which
I [once] destroyed, I show that I am breaking the law. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>For I,
through the law, died to the law, so that I might live to God. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>I
have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who
lives in me. I now live this life in the flesh, but I live [it] by faith in the
Son of God, who loved me and who gave himself up for me. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>I do not
nullify the grace of God! Truly, if righteousness is through the law, then
Christ died for nothing!”               </p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Senseless Galatians! Christ was openly presented before your
eyes as crucified—who then bewitched you not to obey the truth?<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1899" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1899"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1899]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">2</sup>I just want to hear this from you: did you receive the Spirit by
the works of the law or by believing what you heard? <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Are you that
senseless that having begun in the Spirit, you now end in the flesh? <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Did
you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain? <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>He<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1900" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1900"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1900]</span></span></span></a>
who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, does he do it by
the works of the law or by the hearing of faith? <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Even as Abraham “believed
God, and it was counted to him for righteousness,” <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>know,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1901" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1901"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1901]</span></span></span></a>
therefore, that those who are of faith are likewise Abraham’s children. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>And
foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, the Scripture
announced the future Good News to Abraham by saying, “In you all the nations
will be blessed.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1902" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1902"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1902]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">9</sup>And so, those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But
those who depend on the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Cursed is everyone who does not persevere</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">in all the things that are written in the book of the
law,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">to do them.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1903" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1903"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1903]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Now it is obvious that no one is justified by
the law before God, for “The righteous will live by faith.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1904" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1904"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1904]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">12</sup>The law is not of faith, but, “The one who does these things will
live by them.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1905" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1905"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1905]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The law and the promise</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
having become a curse for our sake. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who
hangs on a tree,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1906" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1906"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1906]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">14</sup>so that Abraham’s blessing might also come to the Gentiles through
Christ Jesus, and that we might {all} receive the promise of the Spirit through
faith. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Brethren, speaking of a human example: even a human
contract, once it has been confirmed, cannot be cancelled or altered. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Now
the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. [Notice that] he does not
say, “to seeds,” as if there were many, but as of one, “to your seed,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1907" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1907"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1907]</span></span></span></a>
which is Christ. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>What I am saying is this: the law, which came
four hundred thirty years after the covenant previously confirmed by God in
Christ, does not cancel it to make the promise of no effect. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>If
the inheritance comes from the law, it is no longer from the promise; but in
fact, God granted it to Abraham by way of a promise.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>What then is the law about? It was added
because of transgressions, until the seed to whom the promise had been made
should come, and it was established through the angels, by the hand of a
mediator. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Now there is no mediator when there is only one party,
and God is one. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Therefore, is the law against God’s [own]
promises? Certainly not! If a law had been given which could make alive, then
certainly, righteousness would have been from the law. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>But in
fact, the Scriptures declared all things to be captive under sin, so that the
promise might be given to those who believe—that is, by faith in Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Nevertheless,
before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, locked up to wait for
the faith which would later be revealed. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Hence, the law was our
tutor which was to bring us to Christ, so that we might be justified by faith. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>But
now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor, <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>and you
are all God’s children, through faith in Christ Jesus! <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>For as many
of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>There
is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither
male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>If you are
Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Free children</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_4">4</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Here is my point: as long as the heir is a child, he is no
different than a slave, although being the owner of everything. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>The
heir is under tutors and trustees until the day appointed by the father. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Likewise,
when we too were children, we were held in bondage under the elemental
principles of the world. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>But when the fullness of the time came,
God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>so
that he might redeem those who were under the law and so that we might receive
adoption as children. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>And because you are children, God has sent
forth the Spirit<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1908" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1908"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1908]</span></span></span></a>
of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1909" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1909"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1909]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Therefore, stand firm in the freedom by which Christ has
made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of slavery! <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Behold,
I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no profit
to you! <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Yes, once again, I testify to everyone who receives circumcision
that he is [now] under duty to accomplish the entire law! <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>You who
desire to be justified by the law are no longer under Christ: you have fallen
away from grace. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>As for us, through the Spirit, we wait by faith
for the hope of righteousness, <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>since in Christ Jesus, neither
circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1919" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1919"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1919]</span></span></span></a>
only faith working through love. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>You were running so well! Who came
to block your way so that you would not obey the truth? <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>This
persuasion is not from him who calls you! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>[Remember], a little
yeast leavens the whole batch of dough! <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>I have confidence toward
you in the Lord that you will take no other view; but whoever troubles you will
bear his [own] judgment, whoever that [person] may be.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>But brethren, if I still preach circumcision,
why am I still being persecuted? If it were so, the stumbling block of the
cross would have been removed. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Indeed, I wish that those who
disturb you would then emasculate themselves! <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>As for you,
brethren, you were called to freedom! Only, do not use your freedom to satisfy
the flesh, but through love, become each other’s bondservants <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>because
the whole law is fulfilled in one message,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1920" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1920"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1920]</span></span></span></a>
which is this one, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1921" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1921"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1921]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">15</sup>But if you bite and devour each other, be careful that you do not
end up in mutual destruction. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>I say this: walk by the Spirit,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1922" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1922"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1922]</span></span></span></a>
and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>What the {fallen}
flesh desires is against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh! And
these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that
you desire. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under
the law.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The works of the flesh</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Now the works of the flesh are obvious. They
are: adultery, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>idolatry, the
practice of magic, hatred, strife, selfish ambitions, outbursts of anger,
rivalries, divisions, heresies, <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>envies, murders, excess drinking,
orgies, and similar things. About these, I warn you, as I have done in the
past: those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The fruit of the Spirit—Life in the Church</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre70">22</span></sup><span class="calibre70">On the other hand, the fruit of the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1923" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1923"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre93">[1923]</span></span></span></a> <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>gentleness,
and self-control. Against such things there is no law! <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Those who
belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>If
we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit! <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Let us not
become arrogant, challenging and envying one another.</span>                             </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre27">Brethren, even if someone
is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a person in a
spirit of gentleness. But watch out for yourself in order not to be tempted. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Bear
each others’ burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>If anyone
thinks that he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>But
let everyone test his own work: then one can take pride in himself, not by
comparison with someone else. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Yes, each one will bear his own
burden, <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>but everyone who is being taught in the word should share
all good things with the one<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1924" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1924"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[1924]</span></span></span></a>
who teaches.</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked;
whatever someone sows is what he will reap. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Whoever sows to [the
field of] self-indulgence<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1925" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1925"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1925]</span></span></span></a>
will reap corruption from the flesh. But the one who sows to the Spirit will
reap eternal life from the Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Let us not grow tired of doing
what is good, for we will reap in due season, if we do not give up. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>And
so, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who
belong to the household of the faith.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>See with what large letters I write to you with
my own hand! <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh
are trying to compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not be
persecuted for the cross of Christ. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Even those who receive
circumcision do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you
circumcised so that they may boast<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1926" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1926"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1926]</span></span></span></a>

in nothing, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the
world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>In Christ
Jesus, circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing; only a new creation
{matters}. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>To those who live by this rule, may there be peace and
mercy upon them, and on the Israel of God. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>From now on, let no one
