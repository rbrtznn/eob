<p class="msonormal1">Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the
will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>to the Church of God which
is at Corinth. [You are] those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints, with all those who call upon the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
place, both theirs and ours: <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>I always give thanks to my God concerning you
for the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus; <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>that
in everything you have been enriched in him, in all [manner of] speech and
knowledge; <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>And
so, you lack no gift as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>who
will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>God is faithful, through whom you were called into the

<p class="sectiontopic">Divisions in the Church</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Now I beg you, brethren, through the Name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, to all speak the same thing and that there be no
divisions among you. Instead, may you be perfected together in the same mind
and opinion.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1727" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1727"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1727]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">11</sup>As it is, those who are from Chloe’s household have informed me
concerning you my brethren, that there are quarrels among you. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Now
I mean this: that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I
follow Kephas,” or, “I follow Christ.” <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Is Christ divided? Was Paul
crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>I
thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius, <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>so
that no one should say that I baptized you into my own name. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>(I
also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I do not know whether I
baptized any other.)</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The cross of Christ—No boasting</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Indeed, Christ did not send me to baptize but
to preach the Good News—not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ
would not be made void. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>For the word of the cross is foolishness
to those who are dying, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>As
it is written:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1728" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1728"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1728]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Where is the wise? Where is the expert of the
law? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God ridiculed the wisdom of
this world? <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Since in God’s wisdom, the world through its ‘wisdom’
did not know God, it was God’s good pleasure (through the foolishness of this
proclamation) to save those who believe. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Jews ask for a sign and
Greeks seek after wisdom, <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>but we preach Christ crucified; a
stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>However, to
those who are called, (both Jews and Greeks), Christ is the power of God and
the wisdom of God, <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>because God’s ‘foolishness’ is wiser than human
wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Consider
your calling, brethren, that not many [among you] were wise according to the
flesh, not many powerful, and not [many] of noble birth. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Nevertheless,
God chose the foolish things of the world to put to shame those who are ‘wise.’
[Yes], God chose the weak things of the world in order to put to shame the
things that are strong. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>God also chose the lowly things of the
world, the things that are despised and even the things that are ‘nothing,’ so
that he might bring to nothing the things that are {thought to be important}, <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>so
that no flesh should boast before God. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>But by God’s doing,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1729" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1729"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1729]</span></span></span></a>
you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, as well as
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>so that as it is
written, “Whoever boasts should boast in the Lord.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1730" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1730"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1730]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with excellence

of God. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Indeed, I resolved not to know anything among you, except
Jesus Christ, and him crucified. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>I was with you in weakness, in
fear, and in much trembling.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1732" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1732"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1732]</span></span></span></a>

wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>so that
your faith would not stand by human wisdom but in the power of God. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>However,
we [do] speak wisdom among those who are full grown; yet it is a wisdom ‘not of

wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that was hidden, which God had foreordained
before the ages for our glory, <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>[a wisdom] which none of the rulers
of this world recognized. For if they had recognized<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1735" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1735"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1735]</span></span></span></a>

<sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But as it is written:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Things which an eye did not see, and an ear did not hear,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">Which did not enter into the heart of man,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">These God has prepared for those who love him.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1738" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1738"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1738]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Yet, God has revealed these things to us
through his Spirit, because the Spirit searches all things, yes, [even] the
deep things of God. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>For what human being knows what is truly human
except the human spirit that is within? Likewise, no one truly comprehends the
things of God except the Spirit of God. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>However, we have received
not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, so that we might
know the things that were freely given to us by God. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>These are the
things we proclaim, not in words which human wisdom teaches, but which the Holy
Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with [other] spiritual things. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Now
the natural<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1739" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1739"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1739]</span></span></span></a>

these things because they are spiritually discerned. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>On the other

<p class="msonormal1">Brethren, I could not speak to you as to spiritual persons,
but as to carnal ones—infants in Christ. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>I fed you with milk and
not with meat, because you were not yet ready. Indeed, you are not even ready
now <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>because you are still carnal. As long as there is jealousy,

<sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, if not servants through whom
you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him? <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>I planted, Apollos
watered, but [it is] God [who] made it grow! <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>And so, neither the
one planting nor the one watering is anything: only God makes it grow. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Now
the one planting and the one watering are the same, but each will receive a
personal reward according to his own labor. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Indeed, we are God’s
co-workers! You are God’s field,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1744" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1744"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1744]</span></span></span></a>
God’s building. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>According to the grace of God which was given to me,
as a wise master builder, I have laid a foundation, and another builds on it.
But let everyone be careful how he builds on it! <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>As it is, no one
can lay any other foundation than the one that has [already] been laid, which
is Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>But as one builds on that foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or stubble, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>each person’s work
will be revealed. Certainly, the Day will make it manifest, because it is
revealed in fire; and the fire will test everyone’s work.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1745" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1745"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1745]</span></span></span></a>

are a sanctuary of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you? <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>If
anyone destroys God’s sanctuary, God will destroy him because God’s sanctuary
is holy, and this is what you are! <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Let no one deceive himself: if
anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool,
so that he may become wise. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Indeed, the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God! As it is written, “He has taken the wise in their

nothing against myself. Yet, I am not justified by this, but the one who judges
me is the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Therefore, judge nothing before the time, [that is]
until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and
reveal the motives of every heart. Then each person will receive due praise
from God.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Brethren, I have figuratively applied these
things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you might learn

And what do you have that you have not received? But if you received it, why do
you boast as if you had not received it? <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>[But] you are already
filled! You have already become rich and you have come to rule apart from us!
Yes, and I wish that you would really be rulers, so that we also might reign
with you. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of
all, like men sentenced to death, because we are made a spectacle to the world,
both to angels and people. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you
are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we
have dishonor. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Even to this present hour, we hunger and thirst, we
are naked, beaten, and [we] wander from place to place! <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>We work
hard, with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless [in return]. When we
are persecuted, we endure. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>When we are defamed, we try to
conciliate. We are made as the filth of the world, as the dirt wiped off by
all, even until now. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>I do not write these things to shame you, but
to admonish you as my beloved children. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>For although you have ten
thousand tutors in Christ, yet [you do] not [have] many fathers. For in Christ
Jesus, I became your father through the Good News. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>I beg you

Timothy to you, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you

<p class="msonormal1">Now concerning the matters you wrote to me about: ‘it is
good for a man not to touch a woman.’ <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>However, to avoid sexual
immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own
husband. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due to
her, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>The wife does not have
authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise, the husband does
not have authority over his own body, but the wife does! <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Do not
deprive each other {of marital relations} unless it is by consent and for a
season, so that you may give yourselves to fasting<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1768" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1768"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1768]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Nevertheless, I say this by way of concession,
not as a command. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Indeed, I wish that everyone would be like me.
However, each person has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another
of that kind. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Still, I say this to those who are unmarried and to
widows<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1769" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1769"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1769]</span></span></span></a>

burn. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But to those who are married, I command (not I, but the
Lord) that the wife should not leave her husband <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>(but if she
leaves, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and
that the husband should not leave his wife.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>As for other cases, I (not the Lord) say this:
if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and if she is content to live with him,
he should not leave her. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>[Likewise,] if any woman has an
unbelieving husband who is content to live with her, she should not leave him. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>This
is because the unbelieving husband is sanctified in his wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified in her husband. Otherwise your children would be
unclean, but in fact, they are holy. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Yet, if the unbeliever
decides to leave, let there be separation. The brother or sister is not under

<p class="sectiontopic">Advice to virgins and widows</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment
from the Lord, but I give my opinion<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1771" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1771"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1771]</span></span></span></a>
as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord so as to be trustworthy. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>I
think that it is good (in view of the present distress) for a man to remain as
he is. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be freed. Are you
free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>But if you do marry, you
have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet, those [who
marry] will have tribulations in the flesh, and I want to spare you. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Yet,
I say this, brethren: the time is short, and from now on, those who have wives
should be as though they had none; <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>and those who weep, as though
they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and
those who buy, as though they did not possess; <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>and those who use
this world, as not using it to the fullest.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1772" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1772"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1772]</span></span></span></a>
The reason is that the outward form of this world is fading away. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>However,
I desire that you should be free from [such] cares. He who is unmarried is
concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>But
he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please
his wife. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin:
the unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy
both in body and spirit. But a married woman cares about the things of the
world, how she may please her husband. <sup class="calibre31">35</sup>I say this for your own
benefit; not that I may ensnare you, but [aiming] for what is appropriate, so
that you may serve the Lord without distraction. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>Nevertheless, if
any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1773" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1773"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1773]</span></span></span></a>
if she has past the flower of her age, and if it is required, let him do what
he wills.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1774" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1774"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1774]</span></span></span></a>
He does not sin; let them marry. <sup class="calibre31">37</sup>As for the one who stands
steadfast in his heart, (having no necessity, but having control over his own
will to keep his virginity): he does well. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>And so, he who marries
[his betrothed<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1775" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1775"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1775]</span></span></span></a>]

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">39</sup>A wife is bound by law for as long as her
husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to
whomever she desires, [but] only in the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">40</sup>In my judgment, she
is happier if she stays as she is, and I think that I too have the Spirit of

<p class="msonormal1">Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: we know that we

anyone who thinks that he knows anything does not yet know as he should know. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>On
the other hand, if anyone loves God, such a person is known by him. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Therefore,
concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is
nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Indeed,
although there are [many] things called “gods” in the heavens or on earth—and
there are many [so-called] “gods” and many “lords”—<sup class="calibre31">6</sup>yet, to us,
there is one God the Father, from whom are all things; and we [are] for him;
and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things, and we live through him.
<sup class="calibre31">7</sup>However, such knowledge is not found in everyone. There are some
who eat things sacrificed to an idol with awareness of the idol, and their
conscience (being weak) is defiled. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>But food does not commend us to
God, for if we eat, we are not better; and if we do not eat, we are not worse! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>However,
be careful that your freedom may never become a stumbling block to the weak. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>For
if someone sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, will not
this person’s conscience, if weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to
idols? <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>And thus, through your knowledge, shall the weak brother
perish, for whom Christ died? <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>And so, by sinning against the
brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ!
<sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Therefore, if food causes my brethren to stumble, I will never
ever eat meat, so that I may not cause my brethren to stumble.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Tradition of the Lord’s Supper—Unworthy communion</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>For I received from the Lord what also I
delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed,
took bread. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “Take,
eat.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1794" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1794"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1794]</span></span></span></a>

for you. Do this in memory of me.” <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Likewise, he also took the cup,
after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as
often as you drink, in memory of me.” <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>For as often as you eat this
bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Therefore,
whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in an unworthy manner will be
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>But let everyone do a
self-examination, and then eat the bread and drink from the cup. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>For

brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>You know that when you
were Gentiles, you were enticed and led away to those mute idols, however you
were led. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Therefore, I want you to understand that no one speaking
by God’s Spirit calls Jesus accursed. No one can say that Jesus is Lord, except
by the Holy Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but it is
the same Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>There are various kinds of service, and the same
Lord. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>There are various kinds of works, but it is the same God who
works all things in all. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>But to each one, the manifestation of the
Spirit is given for the benefit of all. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>To one, the word of wisdom
is given through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge, [both]
according to the same Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>To another, faith [is given] by the
same Spirit, and to yet another gifts of healings, [both] by the same Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>To
another it is given to work miracles and to another prophecy. Another receives
the discerning of spirits, another different kinds of tongues, and another
[yet] the interpretation of tongues. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>However, it is the one and
same Spirit who works all of these, distributing to each one individually as he
intends.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">One and many</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Just as the body is one and yet has many
members, and all the members of the body (though many) form one body, so also
is Christ. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
both Jews and Greeks, slaves or free; and we were all made to drink into one
Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>For the body is not one member, but many. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>If
the foot would say, “Because I am not the hand, I am not part of the body,” it
would still be part of the body. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>If the ear would say, “Because I
am not the eye, I am not part of the body,” it would still be part of the body.
<sup class="calibre31">17</sup>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? Or if
the whole body were hearing, where would the smelling be? <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>But now,
God has set the members of the body, each one of them, just as he desired. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>If
they were all one member, where would the body be? <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>But now, they
are many members, but [still] one body. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>And the eye cannot say to
the hand, “I have no need of you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no
need of you.” <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>In fact, the members of the body which seem to be
weaker are indispensable! <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>The members of the body which we think
less honorable, we clothe with greater honor while our less respectable members
are treated with greater respect, <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>although our more presentable
parts have no such need. But God put the body together, giving more abundant
honor to the inferior part, <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>so that there should be no division in
the body. Instead, the members should have the same care for one another. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>When
one member suffers, all the members suffer with it, and when one member is
glorified, all the members rejoice with it.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Now you are the body of Christ, and members
individually. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>God has appointed some in the Church as follows:
first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then wonderworkers, also those
having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of
administration,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1799" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1799"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1799]</span></span></span></a>
and those with different kinds of tongues. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>However, are all
apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers? <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Do
all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>But
earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I [will] show you a most excellent
way.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The way of love</p>

<p class="msonormal1">If I speak with the tongues of men and angels, but do not

I have all faith, so as to move mountains, but I do not have love, I am

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Love is patient and is kind; love does not envy.
Love does not brag, it is not proud, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>it does not behave

[Love] does not take offence and does not keep track of evil, <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>it
does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>[Love]
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Love
never fails.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre27">But as for prophecies,
they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it
will pass away. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>We know [only] in part, and we prophesy [only] in
part; <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>but when that which is complete comes, then that which is
incomplete will be done away with. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>When I was a child, I spoke as
a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become
full-grown, I have put away childish things. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Now indeed, we see in
a mirror, dimly,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1802" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1802"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[1802]</span></span></span></a>
but then we shall see face to face. Now I know [only] in part, but then, I will
know fully, even as I have been fully known. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>But now, faith, hope,
and love remain: these three, and the greatest of these is love.</span></p>

especially that you may prophesy. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>For whoever speaks in another

such a one speaks mysteries in [the] spirit.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1804" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1804"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1804]</span></span></span></a>

I desire to have all of you speak in other tongues, and even more that you
would prophesy. For the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks
in tongues, unless the one who speaks in tongues also interprets, so that the

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in
tongues, what profit is there for you unless I speak either by way of
revelation, knowledge, prophesying, or teaching? <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Consider things

sound, who would prepare for war? <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>It is the same with you: if you
do not utter words easy to understand, how will people understand what is
spoken? For you would be speaking into the air! <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>As it is, there
are many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>But
if I do not know the meaning of the sound, I would be as a foreigner to the one
speaking, and vice-versa. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>And so with you, since you are eager for
spiritual gifts, try to excel in what edifies the Church. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Therefore,
the one who speaks in another tongue should pray that he may [also] interpret, <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>because
if I pray in another tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1807" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1807"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1807]</span></span></span></a>

the spirit, and with the mind also. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Otherwise if you bless with
the spirit, how will the one who is untrained say the “Amen” at your giving of
thanks, not knowing what are you saying? <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>You give thanks well, no
doubt about it, but the other person is not built up. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>I give
thanks to my God: I speak in tongues more than all of you. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>However,
in the Church, I would rather speak five words with my mind than ten thousand
words in another tongue, in order to instruct others.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The purpose of these gifts</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Brethren, do not be children in thoughts, yet

them to speak, as they are to be under authority, as the law also says. <sup class="calibre31">35</sup>If
they desire to learn about something, let them ask their own husbands at home,
for it is not fitting that women should speak in the Church.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">36</sup>Do you think that it was from you that the word
of God went out? Or did it come to you alone? <sup class="calibre31">37</sup>If any man thinks
himself to be a prophet or someone spiritual, let him recognize the things
which I write to you: these are the commandments of the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>But
the ignorant is truly ignorant! <sup class="calibre31">39</sup>Therefore, brethren, have an
intense desire to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <sup class="calibre31">40</sup>Let
all things be done decently and in order.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The Good News and the Resurrection</p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_15">15</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Now I declare to you, brethren, the Good News which I
preached to you, which also you accepted,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1813" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1813"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1813]</span></span></span></a>
in which you also stand. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>And you are saved by it, that is if you
hold firmly to the word which I preached to you. Otherwise, you believed in
vain. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>For I delivered to you, first of all, what I also received:
that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>that he
was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>and
that he appeared to Kephas,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1814" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1814"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1814]</span></span></span></a>
then to the Twelve. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>After that, he appeared to over five hundred
brethren at once, most of whom remain [alive] until now, but some have also
fallen asleep. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Then he appeared to James,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1815" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1815"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1815]</span></span></span></a>
then to all the apostles, <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>and last of all, as to the child born at
the wrong time,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1816" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1816"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1816]</span></span></span></a>
he appeared to me also. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Indeed, I am the least of the apostles,
unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But
by the grace of God, I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not
in vain, but I worked more than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God
which was with me. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>It does not matter whether is it I or they:
this is what we preach, and so you believed.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Now if Christ is preached and we preach that he
has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is
no resurrection of the dead? <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>But if there is no resurrection of
the dead, then Christ has not been raised! <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>If Christ has not been
raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Yes,
we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified concerning God
that he raised up Christ (but if God did not raise him up, then the dead are
not raised). <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Truly, if the dead are not raised, then Christ has
not been raised! <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>If Christ has not been raised, your faith is
vain, and you are still in your sins. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Moreover, those who have
fallen asleep in Christ have perished. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>If it is only in this life
that we have hoped in Christ, we are the most pathetic of all human beings!</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>But in fact, Christ has been raised from the
dead! He did become the first fruits of those who are asleep. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>For
since death came through [one] man, the resurrection of the dead also came
through [one] man. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>As in Adam all die, in Christ all will be made
alive. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>But each in the proper order: Christ (the first fruits),
then those who are Christ’s at his coming. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>When the end comes, he
will deliver the Kingdom to the God and Father—that is, when he will have
abolished all rule and all authority and power. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>For he must reign
until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>The last enemy
that will be abolished is death. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>For, “He put all things in
subjection under his feet.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1817" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1817"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1817]</span></span></span></a>
But when he says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is obvious that this
does not include the one who subjected all things to him. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>When all
things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also subject himself to
the one who subjected all things to him, so that God may be all in all.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Otherwise, what is the point of being baptized
to be as dead?<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1818" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1818"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1818]</span></span></span></a>
If the dead are not raised at all, why are people<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1819" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1819"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1819]</span></span></span></a>
baptized to be on their side?<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1820" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1820"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1820]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Why do we also stand in danger at every hour? <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>I
affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I
die daily. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes,
what gain is there for me? If the dead are not raised, then “let us eat and
drink, for tomorrow we die.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1821" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1821"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1821]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">33</sup>Do not be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.” <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>Wake
up to righteousness and do not sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say
this to your shame.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">How are the dead raised?</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">35</sup>But someone will say, “How are the dead
raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they return?” <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>You foolish
one, even what you sow is not made alive unless it dies first.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1822" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1822"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1822]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">37</sup>What you sow, you do not sow [in] the shape<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1823" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1823"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1823]</span></span></span></a>
that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>But
God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.
<sup class="calibre31">39</sup>Not all flesh is alike: there is human [nature]<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1824" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1824"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1824]</span></span></span></a>,
animal flesh, and also [the nature] of fish and birds. <sup class="calibre31">40</sup>There are
also heavenly<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1825" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1825"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1825]</span></span></span></a>
bodies, and earthly<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1826" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1826"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1826]</span></span></span></a>
bodies; but the glory of the heavenly differs from that of the earthly. <sup class="calibre31">41</sup>There
is the glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
stars; for one star differs from another star in glory. <sup class="calibre31">42</sup>This is
comparable to the resurrection of the dead: something is sown in corruption but
raised in incorruption. <sup class="calibre31">43</sup>It is sown in dishonor; it is then raised
in glory. It is sown in weakness then raised in power. <sup class="calibre31">44</sup>It is sown
as a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body just
as there is a spiritual body.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">45</sup>And so, it is written, “The first man, Adam,
became a living soul.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1827" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1827"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1827]</span></span></span></a>
The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. <sup class="calibre31">46</sup>However, what is
spiritual is not first, but what is natural, then comes what is spiritual. <sup class="calibre31">47</sup>The
first man is from the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from
heaven. <sup class="calibre31">48</sup>As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also
made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1828" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1828"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1828]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">49</sup>As we have borne the image of those made of dust, we will also
bear the image of the heavenly [man]. <sup class="calibre31">50</sup>Now I say this, brethren,
that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption
inherit incorruption.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">51</sup>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all
sleep, but we will all be changed, <sup class="calibre31">52</sup>in a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye, at the last trumpet. The trumpet will sound, and the dead will be
raised incorruptible, and we will be changed. <sup class="calibre31">53</sup>For what is corruptible
must put on incorruption, and what is mortal must put on immortality. <sup class="calibre31">54</sup>But
when the corruptible will have put on incorruption and the mortal immortality,
then that which is written will come true: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1829" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1829"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1829]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst"><sup class="calibre31">55</sup>Death, where is your sting?<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1830" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1830"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1830]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

steadfast, immovable, always active in the Lord’s work, because you know that

<p class="sectiontopic">About the collection and Paul’s plans</p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_16">16</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, do as I
instructed the Churches of Galatia. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>On the first day of the week,
each one of you should put aside and save according to God’s blessing, so that
no collections be made when I come. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>When I arrive, I will send
whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>If
it is appropriate for me to go also, they will accompany me. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>But I
will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, since I have to go
through Macedonia. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>I may also stay with you, or even spend the
winter, so that you may send me on my journey. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Truly, I do not wish
to see you only in passing, but I hope to stay with you for a while, if the
Lord permits. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost, <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>because
a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Now
if Timothy comes, make sure that he has nothing to fear from you, for he does
the work of the Lord as I do. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Therefore, let no one despise him,
but set him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him
with the brothers.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Now concerning Apollos, the brother: I strongly
urged him to come to you with the brothers;<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1832" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1832"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1832]</span></span></span></a>
but it was not his desire to come now. He will come when he has an opportunity.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Encouragements</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous!
Be strong! <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Let all that you do be done in love.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Now I beg you, brethren (you know the house of
Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted
themselves to serve the saints), <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>that you also be in service to
people like this, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>I
rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for what was
lacking on your part, they supplied. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>They refreshed my spirit and
yours; show therefore your appreciation to such people.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>The Churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla
greet you much in the Lord, together with the Church that is in their house. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>All
the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss!</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.
<sup class="calibre31">22</sup>If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
accursed.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1833" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1833"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1833]</span></span></span></a>
