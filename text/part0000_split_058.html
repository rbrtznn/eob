<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Authorship/Dates</b></p>

<p class="msonormal1">1 Peter has always been recognized as an authentic letter of
the great apostle, probably written in Rome or Jerusalem (5:13) with Sylvanus
(5:12) as secretary. It may have been written between 50 and 67 AD.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Conversely, 2 Peter had a long and controversial reception
in the canon of the New Testament. Writing in the mid to late second century,
Origen noted:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">And Peter, on whom the Church of Christ is
built, against which the gates of Hades shall not prevail, has left one acknowledged
epistle, and, it may be, a second also, for it is doubted.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As late as the mid-third century, Eusebius classified 2
Peter among the ‘disputed books’ (<i class="calibre4">antilegomena</i>) and seemed to have
rejected its canonicity:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Of the disputed books which are nevertheless
known to most are the letter called James, that of Jude, the second letter of
Peter, and the so-called second and third letters of John. But the so-called
second letter [of Peter] we have not received as canonical, but nevertheless it
has appeared useful to many, and has been studied with other scriptures.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">(<i class="calibre4">Ecclesiastical History,</i> 3.25.3; 3.3.1-4)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Eusebius’ doubts regarding 2 Peter stemmed from the fact
that unlike 1 Peter, it was not quoted by the early writers.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Modern scholarship is even more negative on the possibility
of ascribing 2 Peter to the second half of the first century and therefore to
the chief apostle. However, the consensus of the Churches crystallized during
the mid-300s and the epistle was accepted as genuinely Petrine. This discernment
took into account the fact that two secretaries or ‘interpreters’ could very
well explain the major differences in styles and vocabularies. Indeed, the
Greek-speaking bishops would have also noticed significant indications that
both epistles had a common mind behind them:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">There are several words and phrases in 1 &amp; 2
Peter that either occur only in these two letters or are relatively rare
elsewhere in the New Testament: “virtue” (aretê) (2 Pet 1:3, 5; 1 Pet 2:9); “manner
of life” (anastrophê) (2 Pet 2:7; 3:11; 1 Pet 1:15, 18; 2:12; 3:1, 2, 16); “to
live in a certain manner” (anastrephomai) (2 Pet 2:18; 1 Pet 1:17); “without
blemish or defect” (aspilos kai amômos [or amômêtos]) (2 Pet 3:14; 1 Pet 1:19
[in reverse order]); “putting off” (apothesis) (2 Pet 1:14; 1 Pet 3:21); “eyewitness”
or “to be an eyewitness” (epoptês or epopteuô) (2 Pet 1:16; 1 Pet 2:12; 3:2); “support”
(stêrigmos) (2 Pet 3:17) and “unstable” (astêriktos) (1 Pet 2:14; 3:16); “never
ceasing from sin” (akatapaustos hamartias) (2 Pet 2:14) and “He has ceased from
sin” (pepautai hamartias) (1 Pet 4:1); “indecency” (aselgeia) (2 Pet 2:2, 7,
18; 1 Pet 4:3); “soul” (to designate persons) (psuchê) (2 Pet 2:8, 14; 1 Pet
1:9, 22; 2:11, 25; 3:20; 4:19); use of the metaphor “growth” to describe
spiritual progress (auxanein) (1 Pet 2:2; 2 Pet 3:18). (Source: course syllabus
for <i class="calibre4">New Testament Introduction</i>, Atlantic Baptist Seminary, Canada)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Moreover, the close relationship between 2 Peter and Jude
actually reinforced the reception of both epistles as genuinely apostolic. The
Judeo-Christian mindset of 2 Peter and Jude is consistent with Peter’s ministry
and with the specific needs of this community; hence, Peter is called “Simeon,”
not Simon Peter or Kephas. It seems that Jude, a brother<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2244" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2244"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2244]</span></span></span></a>
of James of Jerusalem (1:1) (and therefore a relative of the Lord) may have
adapted Peter’s second epistle. However, other scholars favor the view that 2
Peter used Jude as a source since the Petrine epistle is actually longer and
that Peter’s edition deliberately omitted specifically Jewish-Christians
elements such as the references to 1 Enoch and the Assumption of Moses.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Both 2 Peter and Jude are difficult to date and may be
placed between 60 and 110. This later date is suggested by those who consider 2
Peter and possibly Jude as ‘pseudepigrapha,’ i.e. writings placed under the
mantle of a departed prophet or master by their disciples in order to
perpetuate and actualize their teaching and ministry.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Themes</b></p>

<p class="msonormal1">1 Peter deals with the practical aspects of Christian living
and the call to personal holiness of those who have been “begotten again
through to living hope.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">2 Peter is a final admonition on the danger of false
teachers and the tragic consequences of embracing false doctrine or falling
into apostasy.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Jude explores the same themes as 2 Peter and presents
apostasy as a rebellion against divinely established order.</p>
