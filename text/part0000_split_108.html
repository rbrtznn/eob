<p class="msonormal1">There is another possibility to explain the abrupt ending in
16:8 and the different feel of the Longer Ending: that someone other than Mark
contributed to the completion of this Gospel. It may be that before Mark’s
Gospel was finished, a sudden emergency – such as persecution in the city of
Rome – arose and Mark was compelled to place his document into the hands of
another Christian to whom he would have entrusted the tasks of finishing its
text and beginning its dissemination in the churches. Early traditions about
the Gospel of Mark consistently place its origin in the city of Rome, but there
is disagreement about whether it was produced before or after the death of
Peter, upon whose recollections the Gospel of Mark is based. The uncertainty of
this detail, along with other features in the text, are consistent with the theory
that as the Gospel of Mark was being written in Rome in the mid-60s, Peter was
killed, and Mark was suddenly forced to leave the city. Mark then traveled from
Rome to Alexandria, perhaps intending to return when the conditions in the city
of Rome were more stable, but he was martyred in Alexandria in 68 AD. We may
add to this that Mark may have taken a copy and left others behind for use in
Rome and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This idea of multiple human contributors may seem
objectionable to some. However, Christians routinely accept more than one
person’s involvement in the production of other books of the Bible. Paul’s
secretary Tertius clearly added Romans 16:22. Many scholars attribute John
21:24-25 to an unknown colleague of John. Paul, as he began his letter to the
Philippians, named Timothy as his co-author. Silvanus assisted Peter in the
composition of First Peter (see 1 Pet. 5:12). In the Old Testament, there are
numerous instances of small notes, anecdotes, and even entire chapters (such as
Jeremiah 52 MT) which have been added by co-authors or other individuals who
were not the primary human contributor to the book. The book of Psalms
obviously has many authors, some of whom are known (such as David and Ethan)
and some of whom are unknown. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">If a Christian colleague of Mark at Rome was responsible for
the addition of Mark 16:9-20, this would not render the passage non-canonical
or uninspired, inasmuch as many other passages of Scripture are likewise
secondary but nevertheless canonical. What makes a passage original and
authentic is not the name of the person who added it, but the presence of the
passage in the text when the text was initially disseminated for ecclesiastical
use.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The abrupt transition from 16:8 to 16:9 indicates that
verses 9-20 are secondary, but secondary material can be added while a text is
still in production. The internal evidence tends to support the view that
16:9-20 was added while the text was in production: a later copyist attempting
to compose a suitable ending would finish the scene that otherwise concludes in
16:8, instead of suddenly focusing only on Mary Magdalene with no mention of
her companions. It would seem that the primary author intended to describe a
reunion between Jesus and the disciples in Galilee, instead of summarizing appearances
in and around Jerusalem. He would include details about Peter’s restoration. A
colleague of Mark, on the other hand, apparently acted otherwise: instead of
composing an ending for the unfinished text, he may have attached a short
document which Mark had written – a short summary of Jesus’ post-resurrection
appearances. This accounts for the summarized nature of the contents of
16:9-20, it explains the lack of a transition from 16:8 to 16:9, and it
explains why 16:9-20 does not specifically describe a post-resurrection
encounter between Jesus and Peter. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">That theory is more tenable than any other. It is less
complex than the view that Mark intentionally ended his account at the end of
16:8 and thus allowed readers to imagine that the women remained silent, even
though he knew otherwise. And it is less complex than the view that Mark, by
strongly foreshadowing (in 14:28 and 16:7) a meeting between the risen Christ
and the disciples in Galilee, intentionally left his readers perplexed and
unsatisfied. </p>
