<p class="msonormal1">Greek manuscripts do not have any capitalization. Hence, the
introduction of capitalized forms is arbitrary and should be clarified.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The EOB does not currently capitalize pronouns that refer to
divinity. Specific nouns such as ‘Lord,’ ‘Spirit,’ ‘Lamb,’ ‘Son of Man’ and
‘God’ are capitalized. The reader should be aware that the capitalization of
spirit is especially arbitrary and may in some instances influence the
understanding of the text.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">‘Name’ is capitalized when it refers to the divine Name(s).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">‘Good News’ (in reference to the Gospel) is capitalized.
This expression was normatively favored over the more traditional word ‘Gospel.’
The Greek word <span>euvagge,lion</span> often
conveyed the idea of ‘royal news delivered with authority.’</p>
