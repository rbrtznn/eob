<p class="msonormal1">The English word “spirit” (or “Spirit”) normally translates
the Greek <span>pneu/ma</span> (<i class="calibre4">pnevma</i>)
and the Hebrew<span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre3">x;Wr</span><span class="calibre3">
</span>(<i class="calibre4">ruah</i>). For this word, capitalization is a major factor in
leading the reader towards a particular understanding of many passages, and we
have seen that this has no equivalent in Greek and that the decision to
capitalize is quite arbitrary.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn23" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref23"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[23]</span></span></span></a>
In addition to this possible cause of misunderstandings, the meaning of the
word itself is quite varied. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">The first thing to notice is that both <i class="calibre4">pnevma</i> and <i class="calibre4">ruah</i>
also convey the meaning “breath” or “wind,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn24" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref24"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[24]</span></span></span></a>
which explains the subtle nuances of such passages as Genesis 1:2; John 3:8 or
James 2:26. On this basis, we could say that <i class="calibre4">pnevma</i> and <i class="calibre4">ruah </i>are
used in reference to <b class="calibre7">an unseen causal agent whose effects are visible</b>.
The Greek somewhat complicates the matter because <i class="calibre4">pnevma</i> is neuter,
which is why it is never spoken of with personal pronouns. Certainly, there are
solid biblical reasons to believe in the hypostatic (personal, conscious)
character of spirit and Spirit, but an unbiased translation requires the use of
the conjunction “that/which” instead of “who/whom.” Good examples of how this
is handled by various translations can be found by examining such texts as Acts
5:32, Ephesians 4:30 or 1 Corinthians 6:19.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the matter of capitalization, most translations follow
the precedent of the King James Version in which perceived references to “the
holy spirit (of God)” were capitalized as Holy Ghost (Holy Spirit in most
recent translations). As a result, when capitalized, the word “Spirit” is
assumed to mean “Holy Spirit,” even in cases where this may be less than
certain. As it is, “Holy Spirit” appears 87 times in the New Testament, of
which 45 occurrences lack the definite article (as in ‘a holy spirit’ without
capitalization), but in many cases the Greek language does not require it.
There are still 7 cases were the expression is truly indefinite and would
necessitate the translation “a holy spirit” or more problematically “a Holy
Spirit.” These texts are: Acts 8:15; 17-19; 10:38; 19:2; Luke 2:25; 11:13; John
20:22. Unlike other translations, the EOB footnotes explain the possible
nuances of the expression “Holy Spirit/holy spirit” in these instances.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, it may be useful to bear in mind the following
ranges of meaning for <i class="calibre4">pnevma</i> which sometime cause some confusion:</p>

<p class="bulletlist"><span>§<span class="calibre61">  </span></span>The breath or
life-giving spirit which animates the body</p>

<p class="bulletlist"><span>§<span class="calibre61">  </span></span>A person’s individual
spirit, or even one’s private thoughts</p>

<p class="bulletlist"><span>§<span class="calibre61">  </span></span>The spiritual realm
of activity which transcends (and may influence) material reality.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In a related
matter, the EOB dedicates Appendix D to a discussion of John 15:26 and the
Filioque controversy.</p>
