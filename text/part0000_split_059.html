<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to
the Twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings!</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Enduring trials and temptations</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Consider it as all joy, my brethren, when you
fall into various trials, <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>knowing that the testing of your faith
produces endurance. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Let endurance have its full effect, so that you
may be perfect and whole, lacking in nothing. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Yet if any of you
lacks wisdom, let such a one ask of God who gives to all abundantly and without
finding fault; and it will be given to him. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But ask in faith,
without any doubting, for whoever doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by
the wind and tossed. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Such a person should not expect to receive
anything from the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>This is being double-minded, unstable in
every way.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Let the brethren of humble circumstances glory
in their high position. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But the rich should rejoice in being made
humble, because like the flower in the grass, they will pass away. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Indeed,
the sun arises with the scorching wind and withers the grass; its flower falls
and the beauty of its appearance perishes. Likewise, the rich shall fade away
in their pursuits.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Blessed is the one who endures temptation
because after being approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord
promised to those who love him. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>When temptations come, let no one
say, “I am tempted by God,” because God cannot be tempted by evil and he
himself tempts no one. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>But a person is tempted when drawn away and
enticed by his own lust. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Then the lust, when it has conceived,
gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full grown, results in death. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Do
not be deceived, my beloved brethren! <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Every good gift and every
perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom
there can be no variation or shifting shadow. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>He brought us forth
of his own will by the word of truth, so that we should be a kind of first
fruits of his creatures.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Doers of the word</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>So then, my beloved brethren: be swift to hear,
slow to speak, and slow to anger!<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2245" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2245"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2245]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Anger does not produce the righteousness of God. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Therefore,
putting away all [moral] impurity and remains of wickedness, receive with
humility the implanted word which is able to save your souls.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2246" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2246"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2246]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Be doers of the word, not only hearers who delude themselves! <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Certainly,
if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, such a person is like someone
looking at his natural face in a mirror. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Seeing himself and going
away, he immediately forgets what kind of person he was. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>But
whoever looks into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres [in it], not being
a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in doing
so.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>If anyone among you considers himself to be
religious<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2247" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2247"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2247]</span></span></span></a>
but does not bridle his tongue, such a one deceives his heart and his religion
is worthless. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Religion that is pure and undefiled in the sight of
our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their afflictions
and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Partiality and judgment</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord of glory
Jesus Christ with partiality.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2248" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2248"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2248]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Yet, if someone with a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your

and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in, <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>you pay special
attention to the one who wears the fine clothing! To the rich you say, “Sit
here in a good place,” but you tell the poor man, “Stand over there,” or “Sit
here by my footstool!” <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Have you not shown partiality among
yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Listen, my beloved
brethren: did not God choose the poor of the world [to be] rich in faith and
heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Yet,
you have dishonored the poor! Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally
drag you before the courts? <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Do they not blaspheme the honorable
Name<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2250" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2250"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2250]</span></span></span></a>
by which you are called? <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>However, if you fulfill the royal law
found in the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2251" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2251"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2251]</span></span></span></a>
you do well. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But if you discriminate, you commit sin and you are
convicted by the law as transgressors. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Truly, whoever keeps the
whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of everything. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>For
he who said, “Do not commit adultery”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2252" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2252"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2252]</span></span></span></a>
also said “Do not commit murder.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2253" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2253"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2253]</span></span></span></a>
Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a
transgressor of the law. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>And so, speak and act as people who are
going to be judged by a law of freedom. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Indeed, judgment is
without mercy to those who have shown no mercy, but mercy triumphs over
judgment.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Faith and works</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>What good is it, my brethren, if someone claims
to have faith but has no works? Can faith save such a person?<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2254" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2254"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2254]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">15</sup>If a brother or sister is in rags and lacking daily food, <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>and
one of you tells them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” and does not give
them what the body needs, what good is that? <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Likewise faith, if it
has no works, is dead in itself. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Yes, someone will say, “You have
faith, and I have works!” Show me your faith by your works,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2255" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2255"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2255]</span></span></span></a>
and by my works, I will show you my faith.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>You believe that God is one!<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2256" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2256"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2256]</span></span></span></a>
You do well! The demons also believe, and they shudder. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>O ignorant<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2257" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2257"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2257]</span></span></span></a>
one! Will you not recognize that apart from works, faith is dead? <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Was
not our father Abraham justified by works, by offering up his son Isaac on the
altar? <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>You can see that [his] faith was working with his actions,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2258" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2258"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2258]</span></span></span></a>
and that by works, faith was perfected. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Thus, the Scripture which
says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2259" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2259"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2259]</span></span></span></a>
was fulfilled, and he was called the friend of God. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>You see, then,
that one is justified<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2260" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2260"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2260]</span></span></span></a>
by works, and not only by faith.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2261" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2261"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2261]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">25</sup>In the same way, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by
works, by receiving the messengers and sending them out another way? <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>For
just as the body is dead apart from the spirit,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2262" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2262"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2262]</span></span></span></a>
so is faith dead apart from works.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Not many of you should be teachers, my brethren, knowing

raise them up. If they have committed sins, they will be forgiven. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Confess
your offenses to one another and pray for one another so that you may be
healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective! <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Elias
(Elijah) was a man in every way like us, and when he prayed earnestly that it
might not rain, it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months! <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>When
he prayed later on, the sky gave rain and the earth brought forth its fruit.</p>

truth and is brought back by another, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>know that whoever brings
back a sinner from wandering will save a soul from death and will cover a
multitude of sins.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2280" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2280"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2280]</span></span></span></a></p>
