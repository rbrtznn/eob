<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: to the Church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Grace
to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>We are bound to always give thanks to God for
you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith is growing wonderfully and
your mutual love for all is overflowing. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Therefore, in the Churches
of God, we boast about you for your patience and faith in all your
persecutions, and for the afflictions which you endure. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>This is an
obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, so that you may be accounted
worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you too suffer. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>It is
righteous for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>and
to give relief to you who are afflicted with us. This will be when the Lord
Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>bringing
vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the Good
News of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>They will pay the penalty of eternal
destruction from the face<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2030" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2030"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2030]</span></span></span></a>
of the Lord and from the glory of his power, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>when he comes to be
glorified in his holy ones<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2031"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2031]</span></span></span></a>
and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to
you was believed) in that Day.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>With this in mind, we also pray always for you,
so that our God may account you worthy of your calling and fulfill with power
[your] every desire of goodness and work of faith. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>May the Name of
our Lord Jesus Christ<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2032" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2032"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2032]</span></span></span></a>
be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and of
the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ and our gathering to him,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2033" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2033"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2033]</span></span></span></a>
we ask you <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>not to be quickly shaken in your mind. Do not be
troubled by a prophecy, report, or letter allegedly from us, saying that the
day of Christ has come. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Let no one deceive you in any way! This
will not take place unless the apostasy<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2034" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2034"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2034]</span></span></span></a>
comes first and the man of sin<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2035" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2035"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2035]</span></span></span></a>
is revealed, the son of destruction. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>He opposes and exalts himself
over all that is called God or that is an object of religion to take his seat
as God in the sanctuary of God, presenting<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2036" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2036"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2036]</span></span></span></a>
himself as a god! <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Do you not remember that when I was still with
you, I told you these things? <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Now you know<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2037" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2037"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2037]</span></span></span></a>
what is restraining him, so that he may be revealed in his own time. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>The
mystery of lawlessness is already at work!<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2038" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2038"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2038]</span></span></span></a>
But now, there is one who restrains,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2039" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2039"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2039]</span></span></span></a>
until he is taken out of the way. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Then the lawless one will be
revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy by
the manifestation of his coming. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>The coming [of the lawless one] is
according to Satan’s operation with all kinds of power, miracles and lying
wonders,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2040" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2040"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2040]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">10</sup>and with all deception of wickedness among those who are being
lost, because they did not receive the love of the truth so that they might be
saved. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Because of this, God will send them a strong delusion so
that they should believe a lie <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>and those who did not believe the
truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness shall all be judged.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Nevertheless, we must always give thanks to God
for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2041" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2041"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2041]</span></span></span></a>
for salvation through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2042" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2042"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2042]</span></span></span></a>
in the truth. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Indeed, he called you through our Good News to
obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>And so, brethren, stand
firm and keep the traditions which we taught you, whether by word or by letter.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>May our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our
Father, who loved us and gave us eternal consolation and good hope through
grace, <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word
and work.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Request for prayers—Against those who refuse to work</p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">As for other matters, brethren, pray for us, so that the
word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it is with you. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Pray
also that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men, for not all have
faith. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Still, the Lord is faithful; he will establish you and guard
you from the evil one. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>We have confidence in the Lord concerning
you, that you both accomplish and will continue to accomplish the things which
we command you. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of
God, and into the endurance of Christ.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Now we command you, brethren, in the Name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother [or sister<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2043" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2043"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2043]</span></span></span></a>]
who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from
us. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>You know how you should imitate us: we did not behave as rebels
among you <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>and we did not eat bread from anyone’s hand without
paying for it. We were in labor and hardship, working night and day, so that we
might not burden any of you. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>It is not because we do not have this
right, but we wanted to be an example to you so that you might imitate us. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>For
even when we were with you, we gave you this instruction: “Anyone who will not
work should not eat either.” <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Yet we hear about some among you who
live in rebellion, not working at all but interfering with other people’s
lives. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>By our Lord Jesus Christ, we command and exhort those who
live this way to work quietly and to eat their own bread.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>But you, brethren, do not grow tired of doing
what is good. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Take note of those who do not obey our word<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2044" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2044"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2044]</span></span></span></a>
in this letter: suspend your fellowship [with them] to bring them to shame. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Do
not consider such a person as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2045" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2045"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2045]</span></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you
peace at all times in every way. May the Lord be with you all!</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>This is my greeting, Paul, with my own hand!
This is the sign {of authenticity} in every letter: this is my handwriting. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>May
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.</p>
