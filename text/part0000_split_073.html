there was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the center and
around the throne, there were four living creatures full of eyes on all sides. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>The
first creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third
creature had a human face, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Each
one of the four living creatures had six wings, full of eyes around and within.
They have no rest day and night, saying:</p>

scarlet-colored animal [which was] full of blasphemous names, having seven
heads and ten horns. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet,

<sup class="calibre31">8</sup>The beast you saw was, and is not; and it is about to come up out
