<p class="msonormal1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,
according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus; <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>to
Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace [be with you] from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>I give thanks to God to whom I offer divine
service<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2081" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2081"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2081]</span></span></span></a>
as my forefathers did, and with a pure conscience. I always remember you in my
petitions, night and day, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>longing to see you, remembering your
tears, so that I may be filled with joy. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>I also remember your
sincere faith which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and in your mother
Eunice. I am convinced [that it dwells] in you also!</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Timothy’s gift</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>For this reason, I am reminding you to rekindle
the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>For
God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Therefore,
do not be ashamed to be a witness of our Lord or ashamed of me his prisoner.
Share in my tribulations for the sake of the Good News, by the power of God. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>He
saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but
according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus
before times eternal.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2082" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2082"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2082]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">10</sup>This has now been revealed by the manifestation<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2083" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2083"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2083]</span></span></span></a>
of our Savior Jesus Christ who abolished death and brought to light [both] life
and immortality through the Good News. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>For this, I was appointed
as a herald, apostle, and teacher of the Gentiles. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>That is why I
am suffering as I am! Yet I am not ashamed, because I know him in whom I have
believed and I am persuaded that he is able to protect<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2084" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2084"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2084]</span></span></span></a>
what I have committed to him until that Day.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Hold to the pattern<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2085" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2085"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2085]</span></span></span></a>
of sound teachings which you have heard from me, with faith and love in Christ
Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>With the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, guard
the good deposit that was entrusted to you.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>As you know, all who are in Asia have turned
away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>May the Lord
grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not
ashamed of my imprisonment. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>When he was in Rome, he searched very hard
for me and he found me! <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>May the Lord grant him to find the Lord’s
mercy in that Day, for he served [me] at Ephesus in many ways, as you know very
well.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Timothy’s tribulations and commission</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="msonormal1">You, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in
Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>What you heard from me among many witnesses, entrust
likewise to faithful men who will be able to teach others as well. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>You
too must endure tribulations as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>No
soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of this life, in order to
please the one who enrolled him as a soldier. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Likewise, anyone who
competes in athletics cannot be crowned unless he has competed by the rules. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>The
farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Think
over what I have said, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre27">8</span></sup><span class="calibre27">Remember my Good News: Jesus Christ, risen from
the dead, of the seed of David. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Because of this I suffer tribulations
to the point of being in chains as a criminal. However, God’s word<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2086" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2086"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[2086]</span></span></span></a> is not chained! <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Therefore,
I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they may obtain the
salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>This
saying is sure:</span></p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">For if we died with him, we will also live with him.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">If we endure, we will also reign with him.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">If we deny him, he also will deny us.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>If we are faithless, he remains faithful;</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">He cannot deny himself.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Remind the people of these things, warning them
in the sight of the Lord that they should not argue about words: this profits
nothing and it brings ruin to those who listen.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Work hard to present yourself as approved by
God, as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of
truth. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Stay away from godless empty discussions because those
involved in it will become more and more ungodly. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Their word will
consume like gangrene! Some of them are Hymenaeus and Philetus; <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>they
are in error concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2087" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2087"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2087]</span></span></span></a>
and they bring some people’s faith to ruin <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>However, God’s firm
foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2088" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2088"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2088]</span></span></span></a>
and, “Let every one who calls upon the Name of the Lord<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2089" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2089"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2089]</span></span></span></a>
depart from unrighteousness.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Now in a large house, there are not only
vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some are for an
honorable use and some for a dishonorable use. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Therefore, if
anyone purges himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified
and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Flee from youthful lusts! Pursue righteousness,
faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Reject
foolish and ignorant questionings because you know that they result in
conflict. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>The Lord’s servant must not be argumentative but gentle
to all, able to teach, and patient! <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>In gentleness, he should
correct those who oppose him: perhaps God will give them the repentance that
leads to a full knowledge of the truth. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Thus, they may return to
their senses and escape the snare of the devil (who had taken them captive to
do his will).</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Troubled times in the last days, </p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="msonormal1">But know that in the last days, troubled times will come. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>People
will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers,
disobedient to parents, ungrateful, and unholy. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>[They will be]
without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control,
brutal, no lovers of good, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>treacherous, stubborn, self-important,
lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>having an appearance
of godliness but having rejected its [inner] meaning.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2090" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2090"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2090]</span></span></span></a>
Stay away from these people too. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Indeed, some of these creep into
houses and captivate gullible women who are burdened with sins, led away by
various lusts, <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>always learning yet never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
these people also oppose the truth. They are mentally corrupted, and as far as
the faith is concerned, they are rejected. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But they will not go
very far because their folly will be obvious to all, as in the case of Jannes
and Jambres.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s example</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>You, however, have paid close attention to my
teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>persecutions,
and sufferings. You know what happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I
endured those persecutions and the Lord delivered me out of them all! <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Yes,
all those who desire to lead godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>But
wicked impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others, being themselves
deceived. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>As for you, remain in what you have learned, which is
what you firmly believe, knowing from whom you have learned them. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>From
infancy, you have known the Holy Scriptures<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2091" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2091"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2091]</span></span></span></a>
which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ
Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Every Scripture is God-breathed,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2092" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2092"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2092]</span></span></span></a>

profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in
righteousness, <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>so that the man of God may be fully qualified,
completely equipped<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2094" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2094"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2094]</span></span></span></a>
for every good work.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">A charge to preach the word</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_4">4</p>

<p class="msonormal1">I charge you therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus
Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his
Kingdom: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>preach the word. Welcome or unwelcome, insist on it;
reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and instruction. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Indeed,
the time will come when people will not listen to the sound doctrine, but,
having itching ears, they will gather around themselves teachers who agree with
their own lusts. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>They will turn away their ears from the truth, and
be turned to fables. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>As for you, be sober in all things, endure
hardship, do the work of one who proclaims the Good News and fulfill your
ministry.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul announces his end—His loneliness</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>As for me, I am already being offered in
sacrifice, and the time of my release<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2095" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2095"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2095]</span></span></span></a>
has come. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>I have fought the good fight! I have finished the course!
I have kept the faith! <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>From now on, the crown of righteousness<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2096" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2096"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2096]</span></span></span></a>
is reserved for me, which the Lord—the righteous judge—will give me on that
Day, and not only to me but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Do your utmost to visit me soon, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>because
Demas, having loved this present world, has left me and gone to Thessalonica.
Crescens went to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Only Luke is still
with me. Bring Mark along with you because he is helpful to me for service. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>I
have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>When you come, bring the cloak that
I left at Troas with Carpus, as well as the books,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2097" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2097"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2097]</span></span></span></a>
especially the parchments. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Alexander the metalworker did much evil
to me. May the Lord repay him according to his works. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Beware of
him, for he has greatly opposed our teachings.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>At my first defense, no one came to help me,
but all left me. May it not be held against them! <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Still, the Lord
stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully
proclaimed and heard by all the Gentiles. I was delivered out of the mouth of
the lion, <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and
preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory unto ages of ages!
Amen.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Final greeting</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Greet Prisca, Aquila, and the house of
Onesiphorus. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at
Miletus sick. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets
you, as well as Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>May
the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
