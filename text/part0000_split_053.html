<p class="msonormal1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>to the beloved<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2107" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2107"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2107]</span></span></span></a>
Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the Church [that meets] in your
house: <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>I thank my God always, making mention of you in
my prayers, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>hearing of the love and faith which you have for the
Lord Jesus and for all the saints. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>I pray that your communion with
us in the faith may become effective through the accurate knowledge<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2108" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2108"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2108]</span></span></span></a>
of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Indeed, we have
much thankfulness<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2109" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2109"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2109]</span></span></span></a>
and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed
through you, brother.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s entreaty to Philemon regarding Onesimus</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Therefore, even though I am bold enough in
Christ to command you [to do] what is appropriate, <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>yet for the sake
of love, I would rather entreat—I, Paul, now elderly and a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
<sup class="calibre31">10</sup>I beg you for my child Onesimus, whose father I have become in my
imprisonment. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>He was once useless to you, but now he is useful to
both you and to me. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>I am sending him back; therefore, receive him
as my own heart! <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>I desired to keep him with me so that on your
behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>But I did
not want to do anything without your consent: your goodness should not be
forced, but of free will. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Maybe it happened that he was separated
from you for a while, so that you might have him forever, <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>no
longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to
me and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>If then you consider me in communion<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2110" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2110"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2110]</span></span></span></a>
with you, receive him as you would receive me. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>However, if he has
wronged you in any way or owes you anything, put that on my account. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>I,
Paul, write this with my own hand: I will pay it back (not to mention that you
owe me even your own self). <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you
in the Lord! Refresh my heart in the Lord! <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Having confidence in
your obedience, I write [this letter] to you, knowing that you will do even
beyond what I say.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope
that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus,
greets you, <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow
workers. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit! Amen.</p>
