<p class="msonormal1">When exploring the Scriptural evidence for the truth of the
historical orthodox catholic position, one cannot help but immediately focus on
the figure of St. James the Just who, without question, functioned as the
one-man monarchical leader of the Church in Jerusalem. Indeed, both Scripture
and the universal witness of the Fathers illustrate this fact most clearly. For
example, Eusebius of Caesarea, drawing from much earlier sources, directly
states that the Apostles Peter, James [bar-Zebedee], and John appointed James
the Just as the monarchical head (“bishop”) of the mother Church of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Similarly, in Galatians 2:12, as St. Paul complains about
some Judaizing Christians from the Church of Jerusalem, he does not say that
these Jewish brethren came “from Jerusalem” or from “the presbyters of Jerusalem,”
but rather “from James,” thus equating James with the Church of Jerusalem
itself. Also, in Acts 12:17, as Peter flees Jerusalem after his miraculous
escape from prison, he does not command the local flock to “report this to the
presbyters.” Instead, he directly says, “Report this to James,” thereby
indicating that James was the leading authority.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, as with St. Polycarp himself, one could easily try
to ‘camouflage’ St. James within a college of supposedly-equal presbyters. For
example, Acts 21:18 reads:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The next day Paul accompanied us on a visit to
James, and all the presbyters were present.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is clearly reminiscent of “Polycarp and the presbyters
with him.” Yet, while James is not called the “bishop” here, we know from both
the context of this passage (and from the overall witness of Scripture itself)
that James was the presiding leader of these presbyters (i.e. their “bishop”).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Also, in Acts 15:2, when a dispute arose between Paul,
Barnabas and some Jewish Christians from Jerusalem, it does not say that they
decided to appeal to James (the bishop of Jerusalem) about the matter. Rather,
it says that they decided to appeal to “the apostles and presbyters” (plural)
in Jerusalem; and at the Jerusalem council that follows, we hear several times
about these “presbyters” (plural)<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2703" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2703"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2703]</span></span></span></a>
with no direct mention made of a presiding “bishop” or “leading presbyter” in
the person of James. Indeed, it is only in Acts 15:19 that we see him manifest
his leadership. However, before that time, he is merely presented as an organic
element within the college of presbyters at Jerusalem, with Acts seeing no need
to identify him as its presiding head. Such was the mentality of the earliest
Christian communities, and this is what we are seeing in the earliest (Western)
patristic sources, when we hear about the “presbyters” (plural) of the Church
of Rome, with no direct mention of a “bishop.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Indeed if, as both Scripture and the patristic sources show
us, the Apostles appointed one man (James) to act as the leader of Jerusalem,
(which was without question the most important Church of New Testament times,
and the model for all subsequent Churches founded by the Apostles), why would
they set up entirely different systems of Church government elsewhere? However,
it seems logical that the Apostles did not create other systems of government
for the other Churches; but that each ‘college of presbyters’ in a particular
locale always included a leading figure (a ‘proto-presbyter’), who was later
designated as its “bishop” in the Ignatian terminology. This can be seen most
clearly in Scripture itself. For example, we have already presented the witness
of Titus 1:5, which reads:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">For this reason I left you (i.e., Titus) in
Crete so that you might set right what remains to be done and appoint
presbyters in every town, as I directed you.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Here, St. Paul speaks to St. Titus in the “you-singular” in
Greek, thereby showing that Titus possesses the exclusive episcopal authority
to ordain presbyters throughout the entire island nation of Crete — which is
why tradition counts St. Titus as the first bishop of Crete. Specifically, the
authority to ordain is a bishop’s authority. Titus was, without question, the
presiding presbyter (i.e. “bishop”) over all the presbyters he ordained on the
island. Thus, like James in Jerusalem, we see a monarchical system of authority
manifested in New Testament-period Crete.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Yet, Crete was by no means the only place where this
monarchical system existed at the time. In 1 Timothy 5:17-22, as with Titus,
Paul speaks to Timothy in the same Greek “you-singular,” instructing him how to
govern the other presbyters under his authority. St. Paul tells him:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Presbyters who preside well deserve double
honor… Do not accept (“you-singular”) an accusation against a presbyter
unless it is supported by two or three witnesses. Reprimand (singular) publicly
those who do sin, so that the rest also will be afraid. I charge you (singular)
before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to keep these rules without
prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism. Do not lay hands (singular) too
readily on anyone…</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In this passage, it is clear that Timothy possesses
exclusive and personal authority over the other Ephesian presbyters. It is
Timothy himself who is to “accept (or reject) an accusation against a
presbyter” (just like modern-day bishops). It is Timothy himself who is to
“publicly reprimand” a sinful presbyter, so as to inspire pious “fear” in all
the others. It is Timothy himself who must personally “keep these rules” and
not show “prejudice” (one can only ‘pre-judge’ if one has the authority to
‘judge’) or “favoritism” (another reference to authority or the possible
exploitation of authority). And, it is for Timothy himself (just like
modern-day bishops) to “lay hands” upon a man so as to ordain him to the
presbyterate.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Thus, in at least three New Testament city-Churches
(Jerusalem, Ephesus, and Crete) we see the office of what would later be termed
the monarchical “bishop” in action. Furthermore, it is important to appreciate
the fact that the first Christian Churches were based upon the old Jewish
synagogue system that preceded them (e.g. Acts 18:7-8). While these synagogues
clearly possessed ‘colleges of presbyters’ who acted as a governing body for a
particular Jewish community, they also always possessed a ‘leading presbyter’
(e.g. a ‘chief rabbi’), who was the president and spiritual father of the Jewish
community. It was no different for the earliest city-Churches in which this
leading Christian presbyter (<i class="calibre4">protos</i> or first) would eventually be called
“the bishop.” However, it was not a common first century semantic to separate
this leading presbyter (the “bishop”) from his associate presbyters in the
city-Church, but to speak of them as one conciliar body (“the presbyters”)
instead, in accordance with Jewish practice.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Lastly, St. Irenaeus of Lyons (a disciple of St. Polycarp),
along with several other second century Fathers, spoke extensively on the
necessity of monarchical bishops. Irenaeus himself holds up the monarchical
bishop as a safeguard against the countless heresies threatening the Churches
at this time, and even presents us with lists tracing one-man succession from
the Apostles to the reigning monarchical bishops of his own day. The reason for
this interest in apostolic lineage was to demolish the Gnostic claim that the
Apostles imparted “secret knowledge” to some of their followers;<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2704" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2704"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2704]</span></span></span></a>
and that the Gnostic heresies were part of this “secret knowledge.” In this,
Irenaeus brilliantly argues that, if the Apostles were to entrust such
“secrets” to any of their disciples, it would most certainly have included
those to whom they entrusted the care of the Churches. Yet, as he goes on to
point out, none of the succeeding monarchical bishops ever taught anything
remotely similar to the Gnostic doctrines; and the succession lists of these
bishops (available in all of the second century Churches) proved this to be an
indisputable fact. Thus, Irenaeus was basing the very integrity of orthodox
Christian doctrine on the fact that there were always monarchical bishops from
apostolic times.</p>
