<p class="msonormal1">The presbyter, to the elect lady and to her children, whom I
love in truth; and not only I, but also all those who know the truth. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>This
is for the sake of truth which remains in us and will be with us forever! <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Grace,
mercy, and peace will be with you<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2386" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2386"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2386]</span></span></span></a>,
from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in
truth and love.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>I greatly rejoice that I have found some of your
children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Now
I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but the
one we have had from the beginning: we must love one another! <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>This
is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment,
as you have heard from the beginning, that you should live<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2387" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2387"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2387]</span></span></span></a>
accordingly.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Many deceivers have gone out into the world,
people who do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the
deceiver and the Antichrist. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Watch yourselves, so that we may not
lose<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2388" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2388"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2388]</span></span></span></a>
what we have accomplished but receive a full reward. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Whoever does
not remain in the teaching of Christ but transgresses<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2389" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2389"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2389]</span></span></span></a>
does not have God; but whoever remains in the teaching of Christ has both the
Father and the Son. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this
teaching, do not receive or greet such a person. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Whoever welcomes
such people participates in their evil works.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Even though I have many things to write to you,
I do not want to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and
speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>The children
of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p>
