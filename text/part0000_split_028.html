<sup class="calibre31">46</sup>About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lima
sabachthani?” That is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn389" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref389"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[389]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">47</sup>Some of those who stood there heard it and
said, “This man is calling Elias (Elijah)!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">48</sup>Immediately, one of them ran to take a sponge;
he filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. <sup class="calibre31">49</sup>But
the others said, “Let him be. Let us see whether Elias (Elijah) comes to save
him.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn390" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref390"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[390]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">50</sup>Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and
yielded up his spirit. <sup class="calibre31">51</sup>Behold, the veil of the sanctuary was torn
in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. <sup class="calibre31">52</sup>The
tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were
raised <sup class="calibre31">53</sup>and came out of the tombs after his resurrection. (They
entered into the holy city and appeared to many). <sup class="calibre31">54</sup>Now when the
centurion and those who were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and the
things that were taking place, they became extremely fearful and said, “Truly,
this was the Son of God!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">55</sup>Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee
to serve him were there, watching from afar. <sup class="calibre31">56</sup>Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn391" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref391"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[391]</span></span></span></a>
the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The burial of the Lord—Joseph of Arimathea—Events at the
tomb</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">57</sup>When evening came, a rich man from Arimathaea
named Joseph, who himself was also a disciple of Jesus, arrived. <sup class="calibre31">58</sup>This
man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that the
body be delivered [to him]. <sup class="calibre31">59</sup>Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a
clean linen cloth, <sup class="calibre31">60</sup>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had
carved out in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb
and departed. <sup class="calibre31">61</sup>Mary Magdalene was there, and also the other Mary,
sitting opposite the tomb. <sup class="calibre31">62</sup>On the next day (which was the day
after the day of preparation<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn392" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref392"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[392]</span></span></span></a>)
the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate <sup class="calibre31">63</sup>and
said, “Lord, we remember what that deceiver said when he was still alive:
‘After three days, I will rise again.’ <sup class="calibre31">64</sup>Therefore, give orders that
the tomb be made secure until the third day, for fear that his disciples may
come at night, steal him away, and then tell the people, ‘He is risen from the
dead!’ This last deception would be worse than the first.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">65</sup>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go,
make it as secure as you can.” <sup class="calibre31">66</sup>And so, they went off in order to
make the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting a watch.</p>

the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene
and the other Mary came to see the tomb. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Behold, there was a great
earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to roll
away the stone from the door, and [the angel] sat on it. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>His
appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Out
of fear, the guards were shaken and became as dead. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>The angel told
the women, “Do not be afraid! I know that you seek Jesus who has been
crucified. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>He is not here, for he is risen, just as he said. Come,

was lying. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from

Behold, this is my message for you.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear
and great joy, and ran to report it to his disciples. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>As they went

behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">They came forward and took hold of his feet, and expressed

him.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go

that they should go into Galilee. There, they will see me.”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The (Jewish) guards make their report</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>While they were going, behold, some of the
guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had
happened. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>When they were assembled with the presbyters in order to
take counsel, they gave the soldiers a large amount of silver, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>with
these words: “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we
slept. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him
and make you free of worry.” <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>And so, they took the money and did
as they were told. This story is widespread among the Jews to this day.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The Great Commission</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>The eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the
