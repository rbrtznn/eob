<p class="sectiontopic">God is light</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>This is the message which we have heard from him
and which we now announce to you: that God is light, and in him there is no
darkness at all. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>If we say that we have communion with him and yet
walk in the darkness, we lie—we do not practice the truth. </p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The blood of Christ cleanses us from all sin</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>But if we walk in the light as he is in the
light, then we do have communion with one another and the blood of his Son
Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>If we confess
our sins, he is faithful and righteous so that he will forgive us our sins and
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>If we say that we have not
sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us.</p>

that we know him: if we keep his commandments. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>The one who says, “I
know him,” and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is
not in such a person. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>But if someone keeps God’s word, God’s love

which you have heard from the beginning. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Yet in another way, it is
a new commandment that I write to you; it is true in him and in you because the
darkness is passing away and the true light already shines! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Anyone

is still in the darkness. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Anyone who loves his brother [or sister]
remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in such a person. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>But
whoever hates a brother [or sister] is in the darkness and lives<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2361" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2361"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2361]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="sectiontopic">Those who love the world</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Do not love the world or the things that are in
the world. The love of the Father is not in those who love the world, <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>because
everything that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but from the world. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>The
world is passing away with its lusts, but the one who does the will of God remains
forever.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The Antichrist—Many antichrists</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Children, this is the last hour! As you have

<p class="sectiontopic">The anointing remains</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Therefore, what you have heard since the
beginning should remain in you. If what you have heard since the beginning
remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>This
is the promise which he promised us: eternal life. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>I have written
to you these things concerning those who would lead you astray. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>As
for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do
not need anyone to teach you. But as the same anointing teaches you about all
things, [his anointing] is true, not a lie. You will remain in him, just as the
anointing has taught you. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Now, little children, remain in him so
that when he<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2367" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2367"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2367]</span></span></span></a>
appears, we may have boldness and not be ashamed before him when he comes. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>If
you understand that he is righteous, you also understand that everyone who
practices righteousness is born of him.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">God’s children—We will be like him</p>

God’s children, but what we will be is not yet revealed. But when he is
revealed, we know that we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is! <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Everyone

<p class="sectiontopic">Sin is lawlessness</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Everyone who sins breaks the law, and in fact,

was revealed to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Whoever
remains in him does not continue in sin, but whoever practices sin has not seen
him and does not know him.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Little children, let no one lead you astray. Everyone
who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Whoever
lives in sin belongs to the devil, since the devil has been a sinner from the
beginning. This was the purpose of the manifestation of the Son of God, to undo
the work of the devil. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Those who have been born of God do not keep
on sinning because God’s seed abides in them. They cannot go on sinning,
because they have been born of God. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>This is how the children of
God and the children of the devil are revealed: whoever does not practice
righteousness is not of God, and neither is the one who does not love his
brother [or sister].</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">We should love one another in deed and truth</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>This is the message which you heard from the
beginning: that we should love one another! <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>We should not be like
Cain who was of the evil one and who killed his brother [Abel]. Why did he kill
him? Because his works were evil, while his brother’s works were righteous. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Do
not be surprised, my brethren, if the world hates you. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>We know
that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren.
Whoever does not love his brother [or sister] remains in death. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Whoever
hates his brother [or sister] is a murderer, and you know that eternal life
does not remain in a murderer.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>This is how we know what love is: that he laid
down his life for us. We too should lay down our lives for the brethren. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>But

need and yet refuses to help, how does the love of God remain in such a person?<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2372" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2372"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2372]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">18</sup>My little children, let us not love only in word or speech, but in
deed and truth. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>And this is how we know that we are of the truth
and assure our heart in his presence; <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>even if our own heart

believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we should love one
another, even as he commanded. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>All who obey his commandments remain

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-2" id="toc_4">4</p>

are of the world. Therefore, they speak according to [the spirit of] the world,

to us. Whoever is not of God does not listen to us. By this we can discern the

<p class="sectiontopic">God is love—No fear in love</p>

this, love has been made perfect among us, so that we may have boldness in the
day of judgment, because in this world, we are just as he is. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>There
