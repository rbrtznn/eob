Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a
precious faith like ours, with us, in the righteousness of our God and Savior<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2335" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2335"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2335]</span></span></span></a>
Jesus Christ: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the
knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Precious and tremendous promises</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>His divine power has granted us all that we need
to live in godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by glory and
virtue. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Through these things, he has granted to us his precious and
tremendous promises, so that having escaped from the corruption that is in the
world by lust, you may become partakers of the divine nature.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>For this very reason, do your utmost to add to
your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>To knowledge, add self-control;
and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>and
to godliness add brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection, love. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Truly,
if these things are yours and overflow, they will prevent you from being idle
or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But those
who lack these things are blind; they only see what is near and they have
forgotten the cleansing from their old sins. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Therefore, brethren,
do all that you can to make your calling and election assured.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2336" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2336"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2336]</span></span></span></a>
Indeed, if you do these things, you will never stumble. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Thus, you
will be richly granted the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Peter’s reminder</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Therefore, I will not be negligent to remind
you of these things although you [already] know them and are established in the
truth which you now have. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>I think it right, as long as I am in
this tent,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2337" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2337"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2337]</span></span></span></a>
to stir you up by reminding you [of these things]. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>I know that I
shall lay aside my tent very quickly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear
to me. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>And so, I will make every effort [to ensure] that you will
always be able to remember these things, even after my departure. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Certainly,
we did not depend on cleverly invented fables when we told you about the power
and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; we were eyewitnesses of his majesty! <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>For
he received from God the Father honor and glory when the voice came to him from
the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2338" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2338"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2338]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">18</sup>We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on
the holy mountain.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Therefore, we have the word of prophecy made
even more certain, and you should pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a
dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2339" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2339"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2339]</span></span></span></a>
arises in your hearts. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Know this first of all, that no
interpretation<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2340" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2340"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2340]</span></span></span></a>
of Scriptural prophecy happens as something private, <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>because no
prophecy ever came by human will: holy men of God spoke, being moved by the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">False teachers—Slaves of corruption</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, false prophets also arose among the people, as
false teachers will also be among you. They will secretly bring in destructive
heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves
swift destruction. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Many will follow their immoral<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2341" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2341"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2341]</span></span></span></a>
ways and as a result, the way of the truth will acquire a bad reputation. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>They
will exploit you greedily with deceptive words. Their sentence, pronounced long
ago, does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>For God did not spare angels when they sinned
but cast them down to Tartarus<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2342" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2342"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2342]</span></span></span></a>
and committed them to chains<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2343" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2343"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2343]</span></span></span></a>
of darkness to be reserved for judgment. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>He did not spare the
ancient world but preserved Noah (a preacher of righteousness) with seven
others when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>He also
turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemning them to
destruction and making them an example to those who would lead ungodly lives. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>He
delivered the righteous Lot who was very distressed by the lustful behavior<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2344" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2344"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2344]</span></span></span></a>
of these wicked people: <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>that righteous man was living among them
and was tormented every day in his righteous soul when he saw and heard lawless
deeds. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>The Lord knows how to deliver the godly from temptation and
how to hold the wicked for their punishment on the day of judgment, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>especially
those who follow the flesh in a desire for corruption, and have no respect for [angelic]
authority.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2345" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2345"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2345]</span></span></span></a>
Daring and self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of the glorious ones,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2346" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2346"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2346]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">11</sup>whereas angels, although greater in might and power, do not bring
a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>But these
people act as natural irrational creatures [that are meant] to be taken and
destroyed. They speak evil in matters about which they are ignorant and in
their attempt to destroy they will surely be destroyed, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>receiving
the wages of unrighteousness. These are people who consider it pleasurable to
revel in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, amusing themselves in their
deceit while they {celebrate the <i class="calibre4">agape</i>} feast<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2347" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2347"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2347]</span></span></span></a>
with you. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Their eyes are full of adultery and they cannot break
away from sin. They entice unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, and
they are children of cursing. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>They have forsaken the right way and
have gone astray by following the path of Balaam the son of Bosor<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2348" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2348"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2348]</span></span></span></a>
who loved being paid for doing evil. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>But he was rebuked for his
own disobedience: a donkey (with no voice) spoke with a human voice and stopped
the madness of the prophet. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>These people are wells without water,
clouds driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved
forever. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>With their high-sounding but empty talk, they entice
those who were indeed escaping (from those who live in error in the lusts of
the flesh) by [promoting] licentiousness. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>They promise them
freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whoever is overcome
by something is brought into slavery by what has overcome him.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>If, after they have escaped the defilement of
the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are
again entangled in it and overcome [by it], their last state has become worse
than the first! <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>It would be better for them not to have known the
way of righteousness, rather than, after knowing it, to turn from the holy
commandment delivered to them.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2349" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2349"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2349]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">22</sup>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb, “The
dog returns to his own vomit”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2350" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2350"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2350]</span></span></span></a>
and “the swine that had been washed [has returned] to wallowing in the mire.”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The Lord is not slow </p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written
to you and in both of them, I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>that
you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and
the commandment of the Lord and Savior [given] through your apostles. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>First
of all, know that in the last days, mockers will come, walking after their own
lusts. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? Since
the days that our forefathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were
from the beginning of the creation.” <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>But they willfully forget that
in the old days, there were the heavens and the earth, formed out of water and
through water by the word of God. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>By means of these, the world of
old was flooded with water and perished. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>But by his word, the
heavens and the earth that exist now have been reserved for the fire of the day
of judgment and for the destruction of those who are ungodly. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Beloved,
do not forget that with the Lord, one day is as a thousand years and a thousand
years as one day! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as
some people think that he is. Instead, he is patient with us, not wishing that
any should perish but that all should come to repentance. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But the
day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; and in this day, the heavens
will pass away with a rushing noise, the elements will be dissolved by intense
heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2351" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2351"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2351]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Therefore, since all these things will be
destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be in terms of holy
living and godliness! <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>You should look for and eagerly desire the
coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved
and the elements to melt with intense heat! <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>But, according to his
promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness is at
home.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Call to watchfulness</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Therefore, beloved, as you look for these
things, do your utmost to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in
his sight. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, even as
our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2352" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2352"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2352]</span></span></span></a>
with the wisdom given to him. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>He does so in all his letters,
speaking of these things. However, his letters contain some things that are
hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable twist to their own
destruction, as they also do with the other Scriptures. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Beloved,
since you know these things in advance, be careful and fear that being carried
away with the error of the wicked, you might fall from your own secure
position. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Instead, grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, both now and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
