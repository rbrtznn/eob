<p class="msonormal1">Many recent translations have gone to great length to
introduce questionable translation techniques in order to avoid any reference
to “him,” “he,” “man,” etc. In many cases, these translations render singular
constructions such as “he who loves” into a plural, gender-neutral form “they
who love.” On the other hand, the original Greek is often gender-neutral (“the
one believing”) whereas the English may in fact introduce a gender element, as
in “he who believes,” for the sake of common usage.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As can be expected, the EOB/NT does not attempt to
artificially avoid the traditional forms of expression and the
personal-singular emphasis of the original Greek. Singular constructions are
always maintained, except in rare instances (James 5:13-20) where the context
does call for such a translation. In this case, an appropriate footnote is
placed to indicate the fact that the underlying Greek is singular.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">“He who calls his brother…” is often translated “Whoever
calls his brother” or “The one who calls his brother” because this rendition is
both faithful to the text and intention of the inspired writer as well as
reasonably inclusive.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The EOB/NT translates <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> as “brethren” when the
word denotes a spiritual relationship. This is a traditional and
well-understood way to include all the members of the family of Christ. In most
cases, <i class="calibre4">adelphoi </i>does convey the meaning of “brothers and sisters,” but
not always,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn21" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref21"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[21]</span></span></span></a>
as the context may indicate.</p>

of the Lord ‘according to the flesh,’ please consult Appendix E.</p>
