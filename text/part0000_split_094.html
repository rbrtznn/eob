<p class="msonormal1">Perhaps one reason for the mystery and abstract complexity
of this issue is that few people understand what (or better who) the Holy
Spirit is all about. In the Book of Acts, we read:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Paul said to them, ‘Did you receive the Holy
Spirit when you believed?’ And they replied, ‘No, we have not even heard that
there is a Holy Spirit!’ And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy
Spirit came on them, and they began to speak with tongues and to prophesy.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2836" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2836"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2836]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Today’s problem is not that Christians do not know that
“there is a Holy Spirit,” the problem is that few would be able to explain who
the Spirit is and what he accomplishes. Indeed, very few theologians or
apologists who discuss the issue of the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> engage the question of
what we mean by Father, Son and Holy Spirit. St. Augustine (whose ‘work in progress’ <i class="calibre4">De Trinitate</i> seems to have been published against
his will) was among those who, for better or worse, attempted to understand the
trinitarian mystery of the Godhead with imaginative and controversial
analogies.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">One possible way to convey what is meant by Holy Spirit is:</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre4">The Holy Spirit is the divine-uncreated, hypostasis, power<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2837" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2837"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2837]</span></b></span></span></a>
and mind that manifests what is true and existing.</i></p>

<p class="msonormal1">This imperfect but useful definition makes sense when we
consider the role of the Holy Spirit at the Lord’s baptism, the epiclesis of
St. Basil and the fact that “no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy
Spirit.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2838" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2838"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2838]</span></span></span></a>
Hence, the “Spirit of Truth” is the revealer of what is true, the One who
“knows the deep things of God.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2839" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2839"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2839]</span></span></span></a>
The relationship of the Spirit with God (or the Father, in an absolute sense)
and the Word seems clear: the Father is the primordial and causal mind with the
purpose and identity of love and communion. The Word or Son is the expression,
the self-aware agent that executes and communicates the Father’s transcendent
mind. This is the theology of the New Testament:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In the past, God spoke to the fathers through
the prophets at many times and in various ways. At the end of these days, he
has spoken to us in his Son whom he has appointed heir of all things and through
whom he [had] made the ages. His Son is the radiance of his glory, the exact
counterpart of his person,  upholding all things by the word of his power.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2840" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2840"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2840]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is why the Orthodox and patristic tradition insists, as
Fr. Romanides often repeated, that the Angel-Messenger of YHWH is the
pre-incarnate Logos. The incarnate Word is the spoken mind of the Father who is
love and who calls us to communion. But the Word is revealed to other minds as
such (Lord and Savior) only by the work of the Holy Spirit. In summary, the
Trinity expresses the idea of message, messenger and revealer, or mind, word
and meaning.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Within this framework, we can say that the meaning proceeds
from the mind and rests in the word, but the meaning truly originates from the
mind, and does not depend on the word. Yet, the meaning proceeds from the mind
through the word. Even more importantly, this approach does not subordinate the
meaning to the word and allows for the symmetry that is often lacking in
Western theology: the word also proceeds from the mind according to the
meaning.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2841" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2841"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2841]</span></span></span></a>
The Word and Spirit are intertwined and complementary in their ontology and
economy: the Spirit manifested the anointed Word and likewise the Word pours
out the Spirit. This is why the Eastern tradition insists on the invocation of
the Holy Spirit after the words of institution are recited. The supremacy of
the conscious Father-Mind is thus established, as well as the co-inherence or
mutual indwelling (<i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i>) of the Word and Spirit.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, meaning proceeds (ontologically) from the mind only,
independently of the word; this is the Photian intuition. Moreover, meaning
proceeds from the mind to <span class="calibre34">rest in the word</span> and <span class="calibre34">through the word</span>.
If there is a certain collective origination of the meaning from the mind and
word, there may also be also a collective origination of the word from the mind
and meaning. This is what the idea of <i class="calibre4">perichoresis</i> suggests.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2842" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2842"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2842]</span></span></span></a></p>
