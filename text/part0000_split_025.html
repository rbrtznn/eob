<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Authorship/Date</b></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Our earliest witness to the authorship and origins of Mark’s
Gospel is found in fragments from Papias’ writings preserved by Eusebius:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The presbyter [John—not the apostle] said this: Mark
became Peter’s interpreter and wrote accurately all that he remembered, (indeed,
not in order), of the things said and done by the Lord. For he had not heard
the Lord, nor had followed him, but later on, followed Peter, who used to give
teaching as necessity demanded but did not make, as it were, an arrangement of
the Lord’s oracles, so that Mark did nothing wrong in thus writing down single
points as he remembered them. He gave attention to one thing, to leave out
nothing of what he had heard and to make no false statements in them.
(Eusebius—<i class="calibre4">Ecclesiastical History</i>, 3.39)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Relying on Papias and other ancient testimonies, notably
Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius and Jerome agreed on the remarkable origins of
Mark’s Gospel:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">So brightly shone the light of true religion on
the minds of Peter’s hearers that, not satisfied with a single hearing or with
the oral teaching of the divine message, they resorted to appeals of every kind
to induce Mark (whose Gospel we have), as he was a follower of Peter, to leave
them in writing a summary of the instruction they had received by word of
mouth. They did not let him go until they had persuaded him, and thus became
responsible for the writing of what is known as the Gospel according to Mark.
It is said that, on learning by divine revelation of the Spirit what had
happened, the apostle was delighted at their enthusiasm and authorized the
reading of the book in the Churches.” (Eusebius—<i class="calibre4">Ecclesiastical History</i>,
2.15.1-2)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter,
wrote a short Gospel at the request of the brethren at Rome, embodying what he
had heard Peter tell. When Peter had heard this, he approved it and published
it to the Churches to be read by his authority as Clemens in the sixth book of
his <i class="calibre4">Hypotyposes</i> and Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, record. (Jerome—<i class="calibre4">Lives
of Illustrious Men</i>, chapter 8)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, it is well established that Mark’s Gospel was written
in Rome before 70 AD, almost certainly in Greek, although some scholars have
suggested a Latin original or immediate translation. The author, known as John
Mark, was Barnabas’ cousin<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn27" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref27"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[27]</span></span></span></a>
and his parents seemed to have owned properties used by the Lord and the early
Church in Jerusalem. He is mentioned in Acts 12:12, 25; 13:13; 15:37-39; 2 Timothy
4:11; Colossians 4:10; Philemon 24; 1 Peter 5:13.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Mark’s original manuscript seems to have ended abruptedly
with 16:8, thus omitting the account of the Lord’s resurrection, perhaps
because Mark was unable to complete his work. However, the resurrection is
unambiguously foretold in 9:31 and 10:34.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Theme(s)</b></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Mark is written for a Gentile audience unfamiliar with
Jewish customs. The evangelist offers a fast moving account that focuses on the
person and actions of Jesus Christ; the Lord’s emotions such as pity, anger and
sadness are portrayed with unaffected naturalness. The Lord’s inability to
perform miracles in his hometown (6:5) and his two-phased healing of the blind
man (8:22-26) indicate the complete absence of any intention to ‘polish’ or
embellish the narrative. Commentators have often noticed the theme of mystery
throughout the Gospel—the mystery of the Kingdom (4:11) and that of Jesus’
identity. That he was “the holy one of God” was known by the demons (1:24) but
Jesus also warned against reporting his miracles and revealing his identity.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Interestingly, the Gospel begins and ends with two parallel
events: the tearing open of the heavens at the Lord’s baptism and the tearing
of the temple curtain (which had an embroidered image of the heavens) at his
death.</p>
