<p class="msonormal1">In short, the question is, “did Luke follow the LXX or did
the (Christian) LXX copy Luke?” If Luke actually included the second Cainan –
which seems the most likely hypothesis in view of weak MSS evidence to the
contrary – it also seems likely that he did so on the basis of LXX or tradition
(e.g. Jubilees).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In summary, the first hypothesis (that the autograph of Luke
did not include the second Cainan) is possible, but ultimately much less likely
than the opposite. In discussing both possibilities, we have encountered a
proposed explanation for the divergence between two genealogical traditions
(the Hebrew and Samaritan vs the LXX), but this is not without it own difficulties.</p>
