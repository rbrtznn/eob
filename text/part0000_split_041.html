<p class="sectiontopic">Greetings</p>

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-2" id="toc_1">1</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called to be an
apostle, set apart for the Good News of God, <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>which he promised
beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>[This is
the Good News] concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according
to the flesh, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>who was declared to be the Son of God with power,
according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus
Christ our Lord. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Through him, we have received grace and
apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his Name’s sake.
<sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Among them, you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called
to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for
all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Surely,
God (to whom I offer divine service<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1561" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1561"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1561]</span></span></span></a>
in my spirit in the Good News of his Son) is my witness, how unceasingly I
always make mention of you in my prayers. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>I request, if by any
means now at last I may be blessed by the will of God to come to you. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>For
I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift with the
purpose that you may be established;<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1562" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1562"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1562]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">12</sup>that is, that I may be encouraged together with you, each of us by
the other’s faith, both yours and mine.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The wrath of God—Idolatry and immorality</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Now I do not desire to have you unaware,
brethren, that I have often planned to come to you, but so far, I have been
hindered. [My goal] is that I might have some fruit among you also, even as I
have among the rest of the Gentiles. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>I am a debtor both to Greeks
and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>This is
why there is so much eagerness on my part to preach the Good News to you also
who are in Rome.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Indeed, I am not ashamed of the Good News of
Christ!<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1563" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1563"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1563]</span></span></span></a>
It is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew
first, and also for the Greek. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>For in the Gospel<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1564" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1564"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1564]</span></span></span></a>
God’s righteousness is revealed from faith to faith. As it is written, “But the
righteous shall live by faith.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1565" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1565"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1565]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">18</sup>However, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all the
ungodliness and unrighteousness of those who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness, <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>because what is known of God is revealed in them,
for God revealed it to them. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Indeed, since the creation of the
world, his invisible things are clearly seen. They are perceived through
created things, even his everlasting power and divinity. This is so that they
may be without excuse, <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>because knowing God, they did not glorify
him as God or give [him] thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning,
and their senseless heart was darkened.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Thinking themselves to be wise, they became
fools! <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>They exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the
likeness of an image of corruptible man, of birds, of four-footed animals, and
creeping things.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1566" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1566"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1566]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Therefore, God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to
impurity, so that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Having
exchanged the truth of God for a lie, they exalted<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1567" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1567"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1567]</span></span></span></a>
and offered divine service<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1568" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1568"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1568]</span></span></span></a>
to the creature rather than the Creator who is blessed forever. Amen.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>For this reason, God gave them up to vile
passions: their women changed the natural function into what is against nature,
<sup class="calibre31">27</sup>and the men did likewise. They abandoned the natural function of
the woman and burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is
inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their
error. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God
gave them up to a worthless<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1569" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1569"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1569]</span></span></span></a>
mind, to do those things which are not fitting. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>They have become
filled with all [kinds of] unrighteousness, sexual immorality,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1570" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1570"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1570]</span></span></span></a>
wickedness, covetousness, and malice. They are also full of envy, murder,
strife, deceit, and evil habits. [They are] secret slanderers, <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>backbiters,
hateful of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things,
disobedient to parents, <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>without understanding, covenant breakers,
without natural affection, unforgiving,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1571" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1571"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1571]</span></span></span></a>
and unmerciful. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>Knowing the ordinance of God, (that those who
practice such things are worthy of death), they not only do these [very] things
but also approve of those who practice them.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The judgment of God</p>

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-2" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Therefore, you are without excuse, if you are judging! For
in passing judgment on another, you condemn yourself, because you pass judgment
and yet practice the same things. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>We know that the judgment of God
is according to truth and against those who practice such things. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Do
you think that you will escape the judgment of God if you judge those who
practice such things and yet act the same? <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Or do you despise the
riches of God’s<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1572" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1572"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1572]</span></span></span></a>
goodness, tolerance, and patience, not knowing that his goodness leads you to
repentance? <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart,
you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of
the righteous judgment of God. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>He “will pay back to everyone
according to their works;”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1573" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1573"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1573]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">7</sup>[which is] eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works
seek glory, honor, and incorruptibility. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>However, to those who are
self-seeking and do not obey the truth but unrighteousness, there will be
retribution and intense wrath, <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>oppression and anguish. Trouble and
distress will come to everyone who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the
Greek.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>On the other hand, glory, honor, and peace
[are] for everyone who does good; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek, <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>because
there is no partiality<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1574" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1574"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1574]</span></span></span></a>
with God. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Hence, all those who have sinned apart from the law will
also perish without the law, [and] as many as have sinned under the law will be
judged by the law. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>For it is not the hearers of the law who are
righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1575" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1575"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1575]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">14</sup>(Indeed, when Gentiles who do not have the law do by nature the
things of the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have
the law, <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>by showing that the practical expression<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1576" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1576"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1576]</span></span></span></a>
of the law is written in their hearts. Their conscience bears witness, and
their thoughts alternately accuse or defend<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1577" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1577"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1577]</span></span></span></a>
them). <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>This is for the day when, according to my [proclamation of
the] Gospel,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1578" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1578"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1578]</span></span></span></a>
God, through Jesus Christ, will judge the secret thoughts of all.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Indeed, you [who] bear the name of Jew, you
rely on the law and glory in God. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>You know his will, and approve
the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>You
are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who
are in darkness, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>a corrector of the foolish and a teacher of
infants, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>You
therefore who teach another, [why] do you not teach yourself? You who preach
that one should not steal, [why] do you steal? <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>You who say that a
man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do
you rob temples? <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>You who glory in the law by your disobedience of
the law, [why] do you dishonor God? <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>For “the Name of God is
blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1579" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1579"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1579]</span></span></span></a>
just as it is written.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">About circumcision</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre71">25</span></sup><span class="calibre71">Indeed, circumcision gains something if you are a
doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision
has become uncircumcision. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>And so, if an uncircumcised man keeps
the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be accounted as
circumcision? <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Will not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if
it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a
transgressor of the law? <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>For one is not a Jew by being so
outwardly, neither is that circumcision [true circumcision] which is outward in
the flesh. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Instead, someone is a Jew by being one inwardly; and
circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter. Truly,
their praise is not from human beings but from God.</span></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Objections and answers—The domination of sin</p>

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-1-5" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="msonormal1">And so, what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the
benefit of circumcision? <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Much in every way! First of all, the Jews<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1580" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1580"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1580]</span></span></span></a>
were entrusted with the oracles of God! <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>But what if some were
without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God? <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>May
it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is
written,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">That you might be justified in your words,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">and might prevail when you come into judgment.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1581" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1581"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1581]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>But if our unrighteousness commends the
righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous if he inflicts
wrath?<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1582" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1582"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1582]</span></span></span></a>
(I speak as people do!) <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>May it never be! For then, how will God
judge the world? <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>For if through my lie the truth of God overflowed
to his [own] glory, why am I still judged as a sinner? <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Why not (as
we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil,
so that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>What
then? Are we better than they? No, by no means! For we previously warned both
Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>As it is written,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">There is no one righteous; no, not one.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>There is no one who understands.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>There is no one who seeks God.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">They have all turned aside.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The righteousness of God—Faith and the works of the Law</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre71">19</span></sup><span class="calibre71">Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks
to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be closed, and so that

reason is that by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight

of sin comes through the law. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>But now, a righteousness of God has

given to the fathers, <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>and so that the Gentiles might glorify God
for his mercy. As it is written:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Therefore, I will give you praise among the Gentiles,
O Lord,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">And sing to your Name.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1711" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1711"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1711]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Again he says:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1712" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1712"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1712]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Again:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">Let all the peoples praise him.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1713" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1713"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1713]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Again, Isaias (Isaiah) says:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">There will be the root of Jesse,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">He who arises to rule over the Gentiles;</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">In him the Gentiles will hope.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1714" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1714"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1714]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy
and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope and in the power of the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s ministry and plans</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>I myself am also convinced about you, my
brethren, that you are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also
to instruct one another. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>But brethren, I write all the more boldly
to you, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God, <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>that
I should be a servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles. I should serve as a
priest the Good News of God, so that the offering up of the Gentiles might
become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1715" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1715"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1715]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">17</sup>I have my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>because
I will not dare to speak of anything except of what Christ has worked through
me. This is for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>in
the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God’s Spirit.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1716" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1716"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1716]</span></span></span></a>
And so, from Jerusalem, and as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good
News of Christ. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Yes, I have made it my goal to preach the Good
News where Christ was not already called upon, in order not to build on someone
else’s foundation. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>But, as it is written:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Those who had no tidings of him will see.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">Those who have not heard will understand.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1717" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1717"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1717]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>For this reason, I was hindered many times from
coming to you. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>But now, since I no longer have any place in these
regions and since I had for many years a longing to come to you, <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>I
[write that I] will come to you whenever I travel to Spain, in order to be
helped on my way there by you, and first of all to enjoy your company for a
while. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>But now, I want you to know that I am going to Jerusalem to
minister to the saints. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>It has been the good pleasure of Macedonia
and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are
at Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Yes, it has been their good pleasure, as they are in
debt to them. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual
things, they owe it to them to be of service in material things. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>After
I accomplish this and deliver this harvest to them, I will go to Spain by your
way. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness
of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Now I beg you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus
Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your
prayers to God for me, <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>so that I may be delivered from those who
are disobedient in Judea and so that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable
to the saints. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>[Pray also] that I may come to you in joy by the
will of God, and together with you, find rest. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>May the God of peace
be with you all! Amen.</p>
