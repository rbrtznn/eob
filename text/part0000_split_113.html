<p class="msonormal1">Regarding the Ethiopic version, it should be noted that some
commentators claim that Mark 16:9-20 is absent from some of these copies.
However, these claims are typically dependent upon less than comprehensive
research by earlier scholars. Bruce Metzger, after investigating the Ethiopic
evidence, concluded, “Of the total of <span>194 (65 + 129)
manuscripts, all but two (which are lectionaries) have Mark 16:9-20, while 131
manuscripts contain both the Shorter Ending and the Longer Ending.” Metzger
thus showed that unqualified claims about the Ethiopic evidence spread by
earlier scholars (including Tischendorf, Legg, B. B. Warfield, and Eugene A.
Nida) were erroneous. Unfortunately, although Metzger published these results
in 1980, his own influential book <i class="calibre4">The Text of the New Testament</i>
continued to state that “a number of manuscripts of the Ethiopic version” lack
Mark 16:9-20 in the third and fourth editions, in 1992 and 2005.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>In the footnotes of his <i class="calibre4">Textual
Commentary on the Greek New Testament</i>, Metzger did make some corrections. Unfortunately,
in the main text, Metzger’s comments about Mark 16:9-20 remain somewhat one-sided.
Nothing at all is said about Papyrus 45. Nothing is said about the blank space
in Codex Vaticanus. Finally, there is no indication that the pages in Codex
Sinaiticus containing Mark 14:54-Luke 1:56 can be understood as replacement
pages.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Metzger stated that the Mark
16:9-20 is absent from “about one hundred Armenian manuscripts, and the two
oldest Georgian manuscripts (written A.D. 897 and A.D. 913),”</span><a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2897" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2897"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2897]</span></span></span></a><span> without adding some important details. He did not make it
clear that these Armenian copies are very likely descendants from a Greek copy
which the translators of the Armenian Version obtained in Constantinople in 430
– perhaps one of the 50 Bibles which Eusebius had produced for the churches
there, a century before the Armenian translators’ visit. Metzer also fails to
mention that hundreds of other Armenian copies did include Mark 16:9-20.
Finally, he omitted the important detail that the Georgian version was
translated from the Armenian version; without this information, readers get the
impression that the Georgian evidence is independent of the Armenian evidence.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Metzger also wrote that “Eusebius
and Jerome attest that the passage was absent from almost all Greek copies of
Mark known to them.”</span><a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2898" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2898"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2898]</span></span></span></a><span> However, when Eusebius explained what a person could claim
as grounds for rejecting Mark 16:9-20, he submitted different ratios of
manuscripts with and without the passage: </span></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span> a. It is not in
100% of the copies,</span></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span> b. It is absent
from almost all copies, and</span></p>

<p class="msonormal10"><span> c. It is in some
copies, but not in all.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Eusebius framed these statements
as things that a person might say, but it seems unlikely that they all
reflected his own observations. Indeed, when Eusebius answered Marinus’ second
question, he stated that “some copies” of Mark mention that Jesus cast out
seven demons from Mary Magdalene. That, therefore, should be regarded as his
actual observation as far as quantities are concerned.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Another point to mention is that
Metzger’s comment does not allow readers to see that Jerome’s <i class="calibre4">Letter to
Hedibia </i>contains a lengthy extract from Eusebius’ letter to Marinus, which
Jerome loosely paraphrased, condensed, adjusted, and translated into Latin.
Hedibia had sent a series of questions to Jerome, and Jerome, in his reply,
used part of the contents of <i class="calibre4">Ad Marinum</i> to answer her broad question
about how to reconcile the Gospel-accounts about the events that took place
after Jesus’ resurrection. Jerome’s use of Eusebius’ earlier composition is
obvious when we notice that after Hedibia’s broad third question<i class="calibre4">, </i>“Why
do the evangelists speak differently about the resurrection of our Lord, and
how he appeared to his apostles?”, Jerome proceeded to present three more
detailed questions, which are the same as the first, second, and third
questions which Marinus asked Eusebius, in the same order.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>If Jerome’s use of Eusebius’
composition could become any plainer, it would do so when we notice the
contents of his answer to Hedibia: </span></p>

<p class="msoquote">“This problem has a twofold solution. Either we do not accept
the testimony of Mark, because this final portion is not contained in most of
the Gospels that bear his name – almost all the Greek codices lacking it – or
else we must affirm that Matthew and Mark have both told the truth, that our
Lord rose on the evening of the Sabbath, and that He was seen by Mary Magdalene
in the morning of the first day of the following week. So this is how this
passage of Saint Mark should be read: “Jesus arising,” place a little pause
here, then add, ‘on the first day of the week in the morning appeared to Mary
Magdalene,’ so that, being raised, according to Saint Matthew, in the evening
of the last day of the week, He appeared to Mary Magdalene, according to Saint
Mark, ‘the morning of the first day of the week,’ which is how John also
represents the events, stating that He was seen on the morning of the next
day.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2899" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2899"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2899]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>None of this originated with
Jerome; it is a loosely paraphrased condensation of Eusebius’ lengthier reply
to Marinus. The statement, <i class="calibre4">“This final portion is not contained in most of
the Gospels that bear his name – almost all of the Greek codices lacking it”</i>
should therefore not be considered an observation by Jerome about his
manuscripts. Rather, it is Jerome’s repetition of the statement which Eusebius
presented as one of a few different things that a person who rejected the
passage might say.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Jerome’s letter to Hedibia was
composed in 406 or 407; by that time, Jerome usually dictated his letters. So
instead of picturing Jerome drawing a conclusion about the contents of “almost
all the Greek codices” after special research, it is more appropriate to
picture Jerome conserving his time and energy, as he dictated his letter to
Hedibia, by borrowing and adapting the work of an earlier writer. He admitted
to Augustine (in Letter #75) that he had this very thing in his commentary on
Galatians: after mentioning compositions by Origen, Didymus the Blind, and
other writers, he told Augustine, <i class="calibre4">Let me therefore frankly say that I have
read all these; and storing up in my mind very many things which they contain,
I have dictated to my secretary sometimes what was borrowed from other writers,
sometimes what was my own, without distinctly remembering the method, or the
words, or the opinions which belonged to each.”</i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Unfortunately, not only have
several major commentators failed to perceive that Jerome’s statements are
borrowed from Eusebius, but they may even have distorted Jerome’s claim. For
example, NIV translator Ralph Martin wrote that Eusebius and Jerome say that
Mark 16:9-20 “was unknown in all copies of Mark to which they had access,” and
Dr. Ben Witherington III told his readers about “the fact that </span>Eusebius
and Jerome both tell us these verses were absent from all Greek copies known to
them.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Metzger also stated, “Not a few manuscripts which contain
the passage have scribal notes stating that the older Greek copies lack it.”
This claim gives an impression which can be balanced by examining the details of
the scribal notes in question:</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Hlt173607172"></a><span>One
note (in MS #199) says, <i class="calibre4">“In some of the copies this does not occur, but it
stops here.”</i> </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Five notes (in MSS 1, 205, 205abs,
209, and 1582) say, <i class="calibre4">“Now in some of the copies, the evangelist’s work is
finished here, as is also Eusebius Pamphili’s canonization. But in many, this
also appears.” </i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Five notes (in MSS 15, 22, 1110,
1192, and 1210) say, <i class="calibre4">“In some of the copies, the evangelist’s work is
finished here. But in many, this also appears.”</i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Three notes (in MSS 20, 215, and
300) say, “<i class="calibre4">From here to the end forms no part of the text in some of the
copies. In the ancient copies, however, it all forms part of the text.”</i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>Thus, Metzger’s statement pertains
to 14 copies (out of over 1,500). None of the scribal notes say that “the older
Greek copies” lack Mark 16:9-20; instead, three of them explicitly say that the
ancient copies include Mark 16:9-20. In MSS 1, 205, 205abs (a direct copy of MS
205), 209, and 1582, the wording of the note is identical or nearly identical.
This means that we are probably not observing notes by five independent
annotators but rather the repetition of a single note that appeared in an
ancestor-manuscript of these copies. The note in MSS 15, 22, 1110, 1192, and
1210 is the same that appears in MSS 1, 205, etc., minus the phrase about the
Eusebian Canons; the note was probably shortened because by the time these
copies were produced, copyists had adjusted the Eusebian Canons so that they
included Mark 16:9-20.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>In summary, it may be concluded
that we are looking at only three independent notes, two of which mention Mark
16:9-20 by noting that it is in many copies, or is in the ancient copies.
Unfortunately, Metzger’s wording tends to give a very different impression.</span></p>
