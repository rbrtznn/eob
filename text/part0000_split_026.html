<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Authorship/Date</b></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Luke and Acts form two volumes of a single work. Tradition
and internal evidence leave no doubt that Luke, a companion of Paul, was the
author of this highly historical and polished account. Hence, the Gospel was
not written by an eyewitness but by an associate of St. Paul who admitted his
reliance on the work and testimony of others (Luke 1:1-3). On the other hand,
the book of Acts contains many “we” passages (beginning with 16:11) which
indicate Luke’s presence in the events being reported.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Based on the fact that Acts ends somewhat abruptly and
without any information concerning the death of James of Jerusalem or the
outcome of Paul’s trial, we may conclude that both Luke and Acts were composed
between 60 and 66 AD. Modern scholarship suggest later dates, mostly because
the accuracy of Jesus’ prophecies (Luke 21:20) regarding Jerusalem’s
destruction are a challenge for rationalistic minds.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">Theme(s)</b></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Luke’s overarching theme is the universal salvation brought
about by Christ and the fact that the outcast and neglected are embraced by it.
This salvation extends into the life of Church which is the very “I” of Christ
(Acts 9:4,5) and the place of the Spirit.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This economy of salvation begins in Bethlehem and even
reaches “the end of the world,” Rome (Acts 1:8; 23:11). This meeting of Word
and Spirit which brings about a testimony or witness to Jesus as Christ and
Savior is a major thread in Luke’s writings. It is expressed in John the
Baptist (1:15; 35), in Mary as Theotokos and new ark,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn28" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref28"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[28]</span></span></span></a>
in the incarnate Word of God who is often seen in prayer (notably 3:21; 9:29),
and in the Church whose very life is an <i class="calibre4">anaphora</i> and <i class="calibre4">epiklesis</i>,
an encounter of Word and Spirit.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Thus, the book of the ‘Acts of the Apostles’ could also be
called ‘the Acts of the Holy Spirit’ who enables seemingly weak disciples to
become powerful witnesses to “a savior who is Christ, the Lord” (Luke 2:11).</p>
