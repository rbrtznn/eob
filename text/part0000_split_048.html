<p class="msonormal1">Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: to the Church of the
Thessalonians [which is] in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace
to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2015" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2015"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2015]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Praise and thanksgiving</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">2</sup>We always give thanks to God for all of you,
mentioning you in our prayers, <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>always remembering your work of
faith, your labor of love and your patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ,
before our God and Father. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Brethren beloved by God, we know that
you are chosen <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>and that our Good News came to you not in word only,
but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with full assurance. You know how we
lived among you for your sake. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>You became imitators of us, and of
the Lord, having received the word<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2016" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2016"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2016]</span></span></span></a>
with the joy of the Holy Spirit, and this in spite of much affliction. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>And
so, you became an example to all those who believe in Macedonia and Achaia. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>From
you the word<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2017" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2017"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2017]</span></span></span></a>
of the Lord has been proclaimed, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also,
your faith toward God has been known in many other places, so that we have no
need to say anything. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Others have given us a report about how you
received us and how you turned away from idols to God, to serve a living and
true God <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>and to wait for his Son from heaven. God<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2018" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2018"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2018]</span></span></span></a>
has raised him from the dead—Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s relationship with the Thessalonians</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="msonormal1">You certainly know, brethren, that our visit to you was not
in vain! <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Having suffered before and having been shamefully treated
in Philippi, as you know, we became bold in our God to tell you the Good News
of God in a context of much conflict. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Certainly, our exhortation
does not come from error, impurity, or deception. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>But since we have
been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, this is how we speak,
not to please people, but God who tests our hearts. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>We never used
flattering words, as you know, and we never put a mask over greed (as God is
witness). <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>We did not seek glory from men (neither from you nor from
others), even though we could have claimed authority as apostles of Christ. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Instead,
we were gentle<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2019" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2019"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2019]</span></span></span></a>
among you, as a nursing mother cherishes her own children.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>We became so devoted to you that we were pleased
to share not only the Good News of God but also our very souls, because you had
become very dear to us. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Remember, brethren, our labor and hardship:
we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you as we
preached to you the Good News of God. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>You are witnesses with God,
how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who
believe. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every
one of you, as a father does his own children, <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>with the purpose
that you should live worthily of God who calls you into his own Kingdom and
glory. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>For this reason, we also thank God without ceasing that when
you received from us the word of God’s message, you accepted it not as the word
of men, but, as it is in truth: the word of God. And it is at work in you who
believe! <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Indeed, brethren, you became imitators of the Churches of
God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you also suffered the same things
from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>They
killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and they drove us out. Their
conduct does not please God and makes them the enemies of the entire human race
<sup class="calibre31">16</sup>as they want to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles, so that
they may be saved. They are still bringing their sins to full measure, but the
wrath is finally coming upon them.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s plans</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Brethren, although we were deprived of your
presence for a short time (yet not in affection), we tried even harder to see
you face to face with great eagerness. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Therefore we wanted to come
to you. Certainly, I, Paul, wanted to come again and again—but Satan prevented
us. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not
you, when our Lord Jesus Christ<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2020" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2020"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2020]</span></span></span></a>
comes? <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Truly, you are our glory and our joy!                          </p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Therefore, when we could not stand it any longer, we thought
that it would be good to be alone in Athens <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>and to send Timothy,
our brother and God’s minister, and our fellow laborer<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2021" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2021"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2021]</span></span></span></a>
in the Good News of Christ, so that he might confirm and comfort you in your
faith, <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>and that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For
you know that these must come our way. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>This is certain, and when we
were with you, we told you in advance that we must suffer affliction. And this
is what happened, as you know. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>For this reason, when I could not
stand it any longer, I sent Timothy<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2022" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2022"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2022]</span></span></span></a>
so that I might know your faith, fearing that in some way the tempter may have
tempted you, so that our labor would have been in vain. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But Timothy
came back from his visit to you and brought us glad news of your faith and
love. He mentioned your abiding good memories of us as well as your longing to
see us just as we also long to see you. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Through all this, brethren,
we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress through your
faith. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Now we have revived, since you stand fast in the Lord! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>What
thanksgiving can we give back to God for you, for all the joy you give us to
experience before our God? <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Yes, night and day, I pray intensely so
that we may see you again and make perfect what is lacking in your faith. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Now
may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to
you. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>May the Lord grant you to increase and overflow in love for
each other and for everyone, even as we also do for you. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>And may
the Lord<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2023" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2023"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2023]</span></span></span></a>
establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father even to
the end, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Exhortations—Brotherly love</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_4">4</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As for other matters, brethren, we beg and exhort you in the
Lord Jesus: as you received from us how you should live to please God, do so
even more! <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Certainly, you know what instructions we gave you
through the Lord Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>This is the will of God: your
sanctification, and that you abstain from sexual immorality. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Each
one of you should know how to practice self-control of the body in
sanctification and honor, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>not in lustful passions, as Gentiles who
do not know God. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>No one should take advantage of or wrong a brother
[or sister<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2024" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2024"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2024]</span></span></span></a>]
in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we
warned you and testified to you. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Truly, God did not call us for
impurity, but to sanctification! <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Therefore, whoever rejects this
does not reject a human [command] but God, who has also given you his Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But concerning brotherly love, you have no need
that anyone should write to you since you have learned from God how to love one
another, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>and this is what you do toward all the brethren who are
throughout Macedonia. Yet we exhort you, brethren, to overflow even more! <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Make
it your goal to lead a quiet life, to take care of your own affairs, and to
work with your own hands, even as we instructed you. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Thus, you
will live properly in the sight of those who are ‘outside’ and you will lack
nothing.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Hope for Christians who have died</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>We do not want you to be ignorant, brethren,
concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you may not grieve like those
who have no hope. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose
again, in the same way God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in
Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>We tell you the following by the word of the Lord: we who
are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who
have fallen asleep. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God. The
dead in Christ will rise first, <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>then we who are alive and remain
will be caught up<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2025" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2025"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2025]</span></span></span></a>
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. And so, we will
always be with the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Therefore, comfort one another with these
words.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The Lord comes like a thief in the night </p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_5">5</p>

<p class="msonormal1">But concerning the times and seasons, brethren, you have no
need that anything be written to you. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>You know well that the day of
the Lord comes like a thief in the night. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>For when people say, “Peace
and safety,” then a sudden destruction will come upon them, like birth pains on
a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>As for you,
brethren, you are not in darkness to allow the day to overtake you like a
thief. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>You are all children of light, and children of the day. We
do not belong to the night, or to the darkness. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Therefore, let us
not sleep as others do, but let us watch and be clear minded.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2026" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2026"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2026]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are
drunk in the night. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>But since we belong to the day, let us be
sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope
of salvation. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain
salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>who died for us, so that
whether we wake or sleep,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2027" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2027"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2027]</span></span></span></a>
we should live together with him. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Therefore, encourage one another
and build each other up, which is what you [already] do.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Life in the Church</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Now we beg you, brethren, to recognize<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2028" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2028"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2028]</span></span></span></a>
those who work hard among you, who are set over you in the Lord and who
admonish you. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Respect and honor them in love because of their
work.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Be at peace among yourselves. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>We exhort you,
brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2029" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2029"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2029]</span></span></span></a>
support the weak, be patient toward all. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>See that no one returns
evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good, both for one another
and for all.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Rejoice always! <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Pray without
ceasing. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Give thanks in everything because this is God’s will in
Christ Jesus for you. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Do not quench the Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Do
not despise prophecies, <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>but test all things, and hold firmly to
what is good. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Abstain from every form of evil.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>May the God of peace himself sanctify you
completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>He who calls you is faithful and he will carry
this out. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Brethren, pray for us. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Greet all the
brethren with a holy kiss. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>I solemnly instruct you by the Lord
that this letter should be read to all the holy brethren.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you!
Amen.</p>
