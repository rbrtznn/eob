<p class="msonormal1">The presbyter, to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Beloved, I pray that you may flourish in all
things and be healthy, even as your soul is flourishing. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>I rejoiced
greatly when [some of the] brethren came and testified about your truth, even
as you walk in truth. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>I have no greater joy than this: to hear that
my children are walking in truth.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Beloved, you do a faithful work in all that you
accomplish for those who are brethren and strangers. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>They have
borne witness to your love before the Church. You will do well to send them
forward on their journey in a manner that God would approve, <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>because
it is for the sake of the Name that they went out, taking nothing from the
Gentiles. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>For this reason, we should receive such [brethren], so
that we may be fellow workers for the truth.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>I wrote to the Church, but Diotrephes, who loves
to be first among them, does not accept what we say. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Therefore, if
I come, I will call attention to his deeds and how he unjustly accuses us with
wicked words. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brethren. He
also stops those who would do so and throws them out of the Church! <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Beloved,
do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. Whoever does good is of God;
whoever does evil has not seen God.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2390" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2390"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2390]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>As for Demetrius, he has a good testimony from
everyone and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our
testimony is true.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2391" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2391"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2391]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>I had many things to write to you, but I am
unwilling to write to you with ink and pen. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Instead, I hope to see
you soon and we will speak face to face. Peace be to you! The friends greet
you. Greet the friends by name.</p>
