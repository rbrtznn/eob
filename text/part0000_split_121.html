<p class="msonormal1">Throughout history Abraham was referred to as the 10<sup class="calibre31">th</sup>
generation from the Flood, which would be erroneous if the Masoretic and
Samaritan versions were correct (where he was the 9th generation).<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2905" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2905"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2905]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">As it is, Abraham is the 10<sup class="calibre31">th</sup> name in the
Septuagint. In the Masoretic and the Samaritan tradition, Abraham is the 9<sup class="calibre31">th</sup>
generation from the Flood.  However, if the Masoretic is correct, then several
other faithful patriarchs were alive after Abraham. In particular, Shem was noted
to have been faithful, and Abraham was chosen through Shem’s lineage. Not one
of these patriarchs is mentioned in Scripture to have been contemporary with
Abraham, as the Masoretic supposes (with the exception of Melchizedek whom many
say was Shem).<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2906" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2906"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2906]</span></span></span></a>
Abraham was chosen particularly because o-f his unique righteousness in an
unfaithful world; yet if other faithful patriarchs were also alive, this undermines
the natural reading of the story. It is significant, then, that both the
Samaritan Text and Septuagint are in agreement that Shem, and all the other
patriarchs, had already died at the time of Abraham.</p>
