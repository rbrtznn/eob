<p class="msonormal1"><span>When we view all of this external
evidence together, it is clear that the evidence for the inclusion of Mark
16:9-20 in the Gospel of Mark is ancient and widespread. No early Church writer
mentions the abrupt ending at 16:8 until Eusebius of Caesarea in the early
300s. At the same time, citations from Mark 16:9-20 were made by early writers
in France, Rome, Asia Minor, Syria, Constantinople, Egypt, North Africa,
Palestine, Cyprus, and other locations. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>The evidence for the abrupt ending
at 16:8 (and the evidence for the Shorter Ending) appears to descend from a
narrow stream of textual transmission that began in Egypt. When Origen moved
from Egypt to Caesarea around 230, he obviously took many Egyptian manuscripts
with him. Thus, the Alexandrian form of the text of Mark which is attested in
the Sahidic version spread to Caesarea. Such copies, or descendants of such
copies, were the exemplars of Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Meanwhile,
in Egypt, we can theorize that someone wrote the Shorter Ending and made copies
of Mark that contained it. This is congruent with the theory that the longer
ending was added in Rome when Mark left for Alexandria.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>In the early 300s, Eusebius of
Caesarea preferred the abrupt ending of Mark, partly because the copies at
Caesarea that he considered accurate – that is, copies previously used by
Origen, or descended from Origen’s copies – did not contain 16:9-20, and partly
because the shorter text was easier to harmonize with the other Gospels. When
Eusebius oversaw the production of 50 copies which were taken to
Constantinople, he used exemplars of Mark which did not contain 16:9-20 –
although he may have formatted those MSS like Codex Vaticanus, so that the
owners of the MSS could add the passage if they wanted to.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>In 340, after the death of
Eusebius, Acacius became bishop of Caesarea. Acacius oversaw the transfer of
important texts from decaying papyrus onto more permanent parchment; Codex
Sinaiticus was probably produced at that time. Having worked under Eusebius, he
probably shared Eusebius’ preference for the abrupt ending of Mark.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>In the 430s, one of the 50 copies
that had been made in Caesarea under the supervision of Eusebius was taken from
Constantinople to Armenia, where it was used as the basis of the second stage
of the translation of the Armenian version.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span>The non-inclusion of Mark 16:9-20
can thus be shown to have a rather limited transmission-stream. The inclusion
of Mark 16:9-20, however, extends over all forms of the text (Byzantine,
“Western,” Caesarean, Alexandrian, and Egyptian, represented by Codex A, Codex
D, Codices 1 and 1582, Codices L and Delta, and Codex W.) Geographically, early
supporters of Mark 16:9-20 come from Ireland, Britain, France, northern Italy,
Rome, Asia Minor, North Africa, Cyprus, Constantinople, Armenia, Syria,
Palestine, Egypt, and even Ethiopia. </span></p>
