stay at Ephesus in order to command certain individuals not to teach a

homosexuals, slave traders, liars, perjurers and for those who practice

<sup class="calibre31">13</sup>even though I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor, and

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>This saying is faithful and worthy of all

<p class="sectiontopic">A call to prayer</p>

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-2" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Therefore, I encourage that first of all, petitions,

<sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Indeed, this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>who

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>There is one God, and one mediator between God

for all—this testimony [was given] in its own times. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>I was
appointed a preacher and an apostle of these things (I am telling the truth in
Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>I desire, therefore, that in every place, the

without anger or doubting. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>In the same way also, women should wear
decent clothing, modest and fitting, without elaborate hairstyle, gold, pearls,
or expensive clothing, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>but with good works, which is fitting for
women professing godliness. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Let a woman learn in quietness, with
all submission. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>I do not allow a woman to teach or to exercise
authority over a man, but to be silent; <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>because Adam was first
formed, then Eve. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being
deceived, fell into disobedience. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>However, women will be saved
through childbearing, as they remain in faith, love and sanctifying
self-restraint.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2059" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2059"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2059]</span></span></span></a></p>

He should be gentle, not irritable or envious. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>He should be someone

testimony from those who are outside in order to avoid falling into [public]
blame and the snare of the devil.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Deacons, in the same way, must be reverent, not
double-tongued, not addicted to much wine and not greedy for money. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>They

must be reverent, not slanderers but self-controlled and faithful in all
things. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Deacons should be husbands of one wife, ruling their
children and their own houses well. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Those who have served well<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2064" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2064"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2064]</span></span></span></a>

will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of the faith and

profane and old wives’ fables. Train yourself for godliness. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Physical
exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having a

<p class="msonormal1">Do not [sharply] rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a

younger as sisters, in all purity. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Honor widows who are truly
widows. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them
first learn how to carry out their religious duty towards their own family, and
to repay their parents. This is good and<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2069" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2069"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2069]</span></span></span></a>

that they may be without reproach. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>If anyone does not provide for
his own, especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbeliever! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Only widows who are more than sixty years old
and who were married to one man should be enrolled [as widows]. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>They
should be approved by good works: having brought up children, having been
hospitable to strangers, having washed the saints’ feet, having relieved the
afflicted, and having pursued every good work with attention. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>On
the other hand, do not enroll younger widows: when they are overcome by their
sensual inclinations more than by Christ, they desire to marry. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>[Thus
they] fall under condemnation because they have rejected their first pledge {to
remain among the widows}. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Besides, they get into the habit of
being idle and go about from house to house. They are not only idle but also
gossips and busybodies, saying things which they should not. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Therefore,
I think it best that the younger widows should get married, bear children, and
manage their homes; this will give the enemy no opportunity for slander. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>For
already some have strayed to follow Satan. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Believers who have
widows among their close relatives should take care of them. Do not allow the
