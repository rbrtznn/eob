<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre67">The Gospel itself is
anonymous but the author is identified as “the disciple whom Jesus loved”
(21:20). In spite of modern speculations to the effect that this “disciple” may
have been Lazarus (11:3,36), an entire community or someone else, the
consistent and reliable tradition of the early Fathers is that John of Zebedee
was in fact the apostolic origin of the Gospel which now bears his name. There
are indications that the author may have been a (Jewish) priest,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn985" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref985"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre77">[985]</span></span></span></a> a view which is not
incompatible with John’s occupation as a fisherman </span>and which harmonizes
well with the focus of the Gospel (Jerusalem, Feasts, Temple). In the late
second century, St. Polycrates of Ephesus evoked the not-so-distant memory of
the Apostle John with these words:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">There is also John, who leaned on the Lord’s
breast who was a priest wearing the <i class="calibre4">petalon</i> (high-priestly miter or
crown), a witness and a teacher, and he sleeps at Ephesus.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn986" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref986"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[986]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Early Christians (including Theophilus of Antioch, Irenaeus
of Lyons and Clement of Alexandria) have handed down a consistent tradition
indicating that John would have written his Gospel in Ephesus, around the year
96.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn987" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref987"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[987]</span></span></span></a>
Based on internal evidence (such as 5:2 “there <i class="calibre4">is</i> in Jerusalem”), some
scholars also deem it possible that the fourth Gospel was written before the
year 70 AD and completed (or published, or released to other Churches) at a
later time.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As we shall see in our mention of the parallelism between
Jacob/Israel and Jesus, as well as the successive theme of Joseph (of Genesis)
and the Beloved Disciple, there seems to be an intentional focus on a symbolic
and anonymous authorship. This is of course consistent with the unnamed
authorship of the other Gospels and serves to draw the reader’s attention on
the one who is seen in glory—Jesus—as opposed to the one who bears witness.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">On the basis of linguistic data, a few scholars have
suggested that the fourth Gospel may have been originally written in
Aramaic/Hebrew or directly in Greek but with an Aramaic/Hebrew mind. However,
we shall also note important similarities between the Gospel of John and Jewish
Hellenistic themes, notably those of Philo of Alexandria (20 BC—circa 50 AD).<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn988" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref988"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[988]</span></span></span></a></p>
