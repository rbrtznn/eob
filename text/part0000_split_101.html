<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Mark 6:3, which mentions the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> of Jesus, may
also indicate that only Jesus was <i class="calibre4">the</i> son of Mary:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Is this not the carpenter, <i class="calibre4">the</i> son of
Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his
sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This point, although minor, should be noted, especially in
light of the fact that no one else in Scripture is called “son of Mary.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">One of England’s finest scholars, Richard Bauckham,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2870" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2870"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2870]</span></span></span></a>
offered a comprehensive analysis of this text in the <i class="calibre4">Catholic Biblical
Quarterly</i>.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2871" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2871"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2871]</span></span></span></a>.
When “son of Mary” is used in Mark 6:3, Bauckham contends that calling Jesus by
his mother’s name (a metronymic) indicates that locally, there was knowledge
that Jesus was to be distinguished from his “step brothers and sisters” because
the locals knew that these <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> had different mothers. Bauckham
cites various Old Testament genealogies where sons are ‘sons of a woman’ (named
after their mother, not their father) to support this view.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2872" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2872"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2872]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Another indication that the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> were not younger
brothers of Jesus is that their forceful attitude is at odds with the respect
normally accorded to the elder brother. This is especially noticeable in Mark 3
and John 7.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Certainly the most significant indication that the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i>
were not sons of Mary and Joseph is found in the dialogue at cross when Mary
and John are entrusted to each other as Mother and Son:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom
he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then
he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple
took her to his own home. (John 19:26-27)</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This account only makes sense if the Mother of the Lord had
lost her only son and needed to be entrusted to a new ‘son’ who would look
after her. If Mary was the mother of several other children by Joseph, this
entrusting to John would be neither necessary nor socially acceptable. This
was, for instance, St. Hilary’s interpretation:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">If they [the brethren of the Lord] had been
Mary’s sons and not those taken from Joseph’s former marriage, she would never
have been given over in the moment of the passion [crucifixion] to the apostle
John as his mother, the Lord saying to each, ‘Woman, behold your son,’ and to
John, ‘Behold your mother’ [John 19:26–27), as he bequeathed filial love to a
disciple as a consolation to the one desolate” (Hilary of Poitiers, <i class="calibre4">Commentary
on Matthew,</i> 1:4 [A.D. 354]).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The Protestant rebuttal that Mary needed to be entrusted to
a believer because her alleged ‘other children’ did not believe in Jesus is
untenable. There is no indication that <b class="calibre7">none</b> of the Lord’s relatives
believed in him and our Lord must have known that he would personally appear to
James<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2873" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2873"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2873]</span></span></span></a>
(and perhaps to his other <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i>) and that the latter would soon
become not only a ‘Christian’ but even the first bishop of the Mother Church of
Jerusalem. The dialogue at the cross is perhaps the most compelling piece of
evidence that the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> could not have been Mary’s children.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Indeed, the grief which the Holy Theotokos endured at the
foot of cross, described in Simeon’s prophecy as “a sword will pierce your
soul,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2874" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2874"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2874]</span></span></span></a>
must have been that of a mother mourning for her only son:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">NIV Zechariah 12:10 “And I will pour out on
the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and
supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will
mourn for him <b class="calibre7">as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him
as one grieves for a firstborn son</b>.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This may explain why, on his own initiative, the Lord took
it upon himself to approach the funeral procession of Nain:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Soon afterwards he went to a town called Nain,
and his disciples and a large crowd went with him. As he approached the gate of
the town, a man who had died was being carried out. <span class="calibre34">He was his mother’s only
son, and she was a widow</span>; and with her was a large crowd from the town.
When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not
weep.” Then he came forward and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still.
And he said, “Young man, I say to you, arise!” The dead man sat up and began to
speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. (Luke 7:11-15 RSV)</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">As a result, postulating the existence of ‘other children of
Mary’ has the result of depriving the Mother of our Lord of a fullness of her
unique grief as a widow losing her only son in fulfillment of the texts
presented above.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Another passage which points to Mary’s perpetual virginity
is Luke 1:34:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Luke 1:31 And behold, you shall conceive in
the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Jesus; 1:34 And Mary
said to the messenger, ‘How shall this be, seeing a husband I do not know?’</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In the context of the Helvidian theory, this dialogue makes
little sense: if Mary, who was engaged and about to get married, intended to
have a usual marital relationship with Joseph, it would have been with the
expectation that she would naturally conceive a child. The answer should have
been, “Yes, I shall conceive because I am about to get married, and you Gabriel
are telling that it shall be a son and that he will be great.” Instead, the
idea that she will conceive is seen as impossible and the reply seems to
indicate that Mary was a consecrated virgin who had taken a vow of virginity.
This is the understanding presented in an influential early Christian text
known as the <i class="calibre4">Protevangelium of James</i><a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2875" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2875"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2875]</span></span></span></a>
where Joseph is presented as a widower with other children who would act as
betrothed protector of the Virgin.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The New Testament gives us an indication that this practice
of ‘betrothal protection,’ undoubtedly unusual to modern minds, was widely
adopted, probably in imitation of the Theotokos and St. Joseph:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent"><sup class="calibre31">36</sup>Nevertheless, if any man thinks
that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2876" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2876"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2876]</span></span></span></a>
if she has past the flower of her age, and if it is required, let him do what
he wills:<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2877" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2877"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2877]</span></span></span></a>
he does not sin, let them marry. <sup class="calibre31">37</sup>As for the one who stands
steadfast in his heart, (having no necessity, but having control over his own
heart to keep his virginity): he does well. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>And so, he who marries
his [betrothed] virgin does well, and he who does not does better. (EOB: 1
Corinthians 7:36-38)</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Finally, we should consider the age relationship between
Jesus and his most prominent <i class="calibre4">adelphos</i>: James. The Helvidian view would
require that Joseph and Mary would have had six to seven children including
Jesus, and that James would have been Jesus’ ‘younger brother.’ Not only is
this perspective improbable practically and culturally, it is also contradicted
by at least one indication that James was older than Jesus. Although neither
Hegesippus nor Eusebius specifically addressed James’ age at his martyrdom in
62-66 AD, Epiphanius (†403) indicated that he was ninety-two years old.
However, James would have had to be less than 62-68 years old at his death for
the Helvidian view to be tenable.</p>
