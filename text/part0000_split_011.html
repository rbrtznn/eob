<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The Greek words <span>dia,konoj</span>
(<i class="calibre4">diakonos</i>), <span>presbu,teroj </span>(<i class="calibre4">presbyteros</i>)
and <span>evpi,skopoj </span>(<i class="calibre4">episkopos</i>),
are translated respectively as “deacon” (instead of “servant” or “minister”),
“presbyter” (instead of “elder”) and<span>
</span>“overseer.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The modern English word “priest” is derived from “presbyter”
but in a confused manner: it actually conveys the idea of “one who offers a
sacrifice,” which in Greek is <span>i`ereu.j
</span>(<i class="calibre4">hiereus</i>) and<span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre3">!hek</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>(<i class="calibre4">kohen</i>) in Hebrew. The Greek Orthodox
tradition has properly retained the distinction between <span>presbu,teroj </span>and <span>i`ereu.j</span>;
the latter is applied to the Christian minister of the altar in his function as
offerer of the Eucharistic gifts on behalf of the priestly people, which is why
the Christian “priest” (Greek: <span>i`ereu.j</span>
Latin: <i class="calibre4">sacerdos</i>) <i class="calibre4">par excellence</i> originally was and still is the
bishop. It is only with the development of the presbyter-led parish that the
term “priest” (<span>i`ereu.j</span>) came
to be applied to the presbyter in his function as celebrant of the Eucharist.
To this day, the annual directory of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America
uses the title of “presbyter,” thereby maintaining the most traditional and
theologically accurate terminology.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In the New Testament, presbyter and overseer are
interchangeable and synonymous,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn9" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref9"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[9]</span></span></span></a>
which is why the EOB/NT translates <span>evpi,skopoj
</span>(<i class="calibre4">episkopos</i>) as “overseer,” not “bishop.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">For more information on the meaning of these terms and the
biblical-apostolic origins of the so-called Monarchic episcopate, please refer
