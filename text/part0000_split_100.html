<p class="msonormal1">This exegesis by a native Greek speaker and Biblical exegete
leads us back to the question of the Scriptural terminology:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2861" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2861"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2861]</span></span></span></a>
Matthew 1:18 And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary
having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together, she was found to
have conceived from the Holy Spirit…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Matthew 1:24 And Joseph, having risen from
the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2862" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2862"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2862]</span></span></span></a>
his wife…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Matthew 1:25 And did not know her until<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2863" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2863"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2863]</span></span></span></a>
she brought forth her son — the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Luke 2:7 And she brought forth her son —
the first-born, and wrapped him up, and laid him down in the manger, because
there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Matthew 12:46 And while he was yet speaking
to the multitudes, lo, his mother and brethren had stood without, seeking to
speak to him, and one said to him, ‘Behold, your mother and your brothers stand
outside, seeking to speak to you.’ And he answering said to him who spoke to
him, ‘Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?’</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Matthew 13:55 Is not this the carpenter’s
son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, and Joses, and
Simon, and Judas? And his sisters — are they not all with us?</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">RSV Mark 3:31 And his mother and his brothers
came; and standing outside they sent to him and called him.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Luke 8:19 And there came unto him his mother
and brothers, and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT John 2:12 after this he went down to
Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; and there
they remained not many days.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">RSV John 7:1-5 After this Jesus went about in
Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him…So
his brothers said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples
may see the works you are doing. For no man works in secret if he seeks to be
known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.” For
even his brothers did not believe in him…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT John 7:10 And when his brothers went up,
then also he himself went up to the feast, not manifestly, but as in secret…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Acts 1:14 These all were continuing with one
accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus,
and with his brothers…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">YLT Galatians 1:19 And other of the apostles I
did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord…</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As we can see, the argumentation in favor of the
Helvidian/Protestant view rests on what seems to be the most natural reading of
the text, especially from a modern mindset and considered in a translated
version. Let us then review these texts in order.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As John Chrysostom observed, Matthew 1:18 stresses the fact
that St. Joseph had positively nothing to do with the conception of Jesus. Even
though he was betrothed to Mary, he had not known her before she became
pregnant, and Matthew makes sure that this point is established so that the
application of Isaias (Isaiah) 7:14 LXX can be justified. As all scholars
recognize, this text gives no information as to what happened afterwards. In
fact, Matthew 1:24 tells us that following a supernatural dream, the righteous
Joseph accepted to “take charge of her,” “to take her to himself,” or “to take
her home.” The Greek word <span>pare,laben
</span>can have a variety of meanings, but the traditional Orthodox
understanding is that Joseph accepted to continue his responsibility of
protection towards Mary in spite of her unexpected (and supernatural)
pregnancy.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Matthew 1:25 contains the controversial expression “until”
which may certainly indicate a reversal in the course of action, especially in
its <span>e[wj ou</span> form. We have already
encountered the exegesis presented by St. John Chrysostom which refuted the
idea of reversal in the previous course of action (which was abstinence). In
the light of recent attempts by Protestant apologists<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2864" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2864"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2864]</span></span></span></a>
to establish a rule of Greek construction to the effect that <span>e[wj ou</span> would always imply a
reversal, it is especially important to realize that both Chrysostom and Origen
(who rejected the reversal idea) were intimately conversant with the Greek
language in its manifold forms,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2865" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2865"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2865]</span></span></span></a>
especially that of the Septuagint and of the New Testament. If <span>e[wj ou</span> always meant reversal for
native Greek speakers, this would have been known to all and their arguments
would have been absurd. Because Origen was the foremost Greek scholar of the
Early Church, his assessment cannot be refuted by modern speculations as to the
possible exclusive meaning of <span>e[wj
ou</span> at that time that Matthew was composed:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">For if Mary, as those declare who with sound
mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, Woman,
behold thy son… (<i class="calibre4">Commentary on John,</i> 1.6) </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Book [the Protoevangelium] of James
[records] that the brothers of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom
he married before Mary. Now, those who say so wish to preserve the honor of
Mary in virginity to the end, so that body of hers which was appointed to
minister to the Word… might not know intercourse with a man after the Holy
Spirit came into her and the power from on high overshadowed her. And I think
it in harmony with reason that Jesus was the first-fruit among men of the
purity which consists in [perpetual] chastity, and Mary was among women. For it
were not pious to ascribe to any other than to her the first-fruit of virginity.
(Origen, <i class="calibre4">Commentary on Matthew,</i> 2:17 [A.D. 248]).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Greek Fathers knew their beloved language quite well,
and they understood the permanent influence of Septuagintal terminology in the
New Testament,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2866" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2866"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2866]</span></span></span></a>
even as “Thou shalt not” is used and understood by all even to this day.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In Luke 2:7, the “firstborn” argument (with the suggestion
that “firstborn” implies subsequent children) seems especially weak since <i class="calibre4">prototokos</i>
only implies a special legal status for “the one who opens the womb” (Exodus
13:2, Numbers 8:16).<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2867" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2867"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2867]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">We then come to the meaning of the Greek word <i class="calibre4">adelphos</i>
(brother). Obviously, this word can have the meaning of brother in the
biological sense and this can be generally taken as the natural sense (as in Matthew
4:21 to describe the relationship of James and John).<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2868" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2868"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2868]</span></span></span></a>
Moreover, we should note that the Greek language had a specific word for cousin
(<i class="calibre4">anepsios</i>) and kinsman (<i class="calibre4">sungenes</i>), although the latter had a very
wide meaning, most often that of “fellow countryman.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the Septuagint, <i class="calibre4">adelphos</i> often meant “close
relative,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2869" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2869"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2869]</span></span></span></a>
and it is interesting that in the New Testament, <i class="calibre4">adelphos</i> is best
translated as “close one,” both in the biological and spiritual sense. If we
consider the New Testament use of <i class="calibre4">adelphos</i> in the framework of the
Epiphanian view, it becomes apparent that neither <i class="calibre4">anepsios</i> nor <i class="calibre4">sungenes</i>
would do: the Theotokos would have been a widow with an only-son, and she would
have been “adopted” by the family clan (or clans—both on Joseph’s side and her
own). Hence, the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> would have been a combination of step-brothers
(Joseph’s sons by a previous marriage) and cousins (through Mary’s relatives
and through Clopas who may have been Joseph’s brother). In summary, <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i>
is the word that we should expect to find in the New Testament to describe the
Lord’s ‘close relatives’ but not necessarily ‘biological siblings.’</p>

<p class="msonormal1">At this point, we can see that there are no direct,
unambiguous reasons that would force the biblical student to conclude that
Joseph and Mary had other children. Indeed, it is significant that <span class="calibre34">no one in
Scripture is called son or daughter of Mary, except Jesus Christ himself</span>.
In fact, we can now turn to positive evidence, or at least indications that
Jesus was in fact the first-born and only-born son, as this was discerned by
the God-illumined Fathers.</p>
