<p class="msonormal1">The same Fathers who discerned the canon of the New
Testament, read Greek natively, and left us a model of reverence for the
biblical text are the same Fathers who called the mother of our Lord not only
‘Theotokos’ (bearer of the divine one) but also ‘<i class="calibre4">aeiparthenos</i>’
(ever-virgin). Indeed, not a single Father or Council ever interpreted the
Scriptures to teach that the Mother of the Savior who is the very icon of the
Church had more than one biological child. According to the bold witness of
Scripture,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2893" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2893"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2893]</span></span></span></a>
we are brothers and sisters of the Great High Priest, sharing one Father and
indeed one ‘Mother’ who is inseparably connected with the Church, the Spirit
and the Theotokos.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, the same Athanasius who was the first to list the
canonical books of the New Testament could also write:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Let those, therefore, who deny that the Son is
by nature from the Father and proper to his essence deny also that he took true
human flesh from the <b class="calibre7">ever-virgin</b> Mary. (Athanasius, <i class="calibre4">Discourses
Against the Arians,</i> 2:70).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">With the saints glorified by the vision of the Lord of Glory
and the contemplation of and participation in the holy mysteries beyond the
curtain, we can say with the inspired psalmist:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">So great is your faithful love, I may come into
your house, and I bow down before your holy temple, filled with awe! (Psalm 5:7)</p>
