<p class="msonormal1">Three theories have been presented to account for the
complex philological,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2852" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2852"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2852]</span></span></span></a>
contextual and theological data contained in Holy Scripture.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The so-called <b class="calibre7">Epiphanian view</b> (named after St.
Epiphanius of Salamis in Cyprus) is the traditional position of Eastern
Orthodoxy and the preferred exegesis of the Greek Fathers. It holds that the
brothers and sisters of the Lord are most probably children of Joseph by a
previous marriage as well as other close relatives such as cousins, etc.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2853" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2853"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2853]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The <b class="calibre7">Helvidian view</b> (named after Helvidius who was
Jerome’s opponent in the controversy) is that of most Evangelicals and
Protestants today: it holds that the “brothers and sisters” mentioned in the
New Testament are children which Joseph had with Mary subsequent to the birth
of Jesus.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, what I shall call the <b class="calibre7">Jeromian view</b><a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2854" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2854"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2854]</span></span></span></a>
is named after St. Jerome who did not accept the idea that the “brothers and
sisters” could have been children of Joseph (whose virginity he also sought to
uphold). Instead, he proposed an interpretation of the Scriptural data which
concluded that the “brothers and sisters” were in fact close cousins. This is
the preferred (if not official) position of Roman Catholic theology.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As we shall see, the Scriptural data is more complex than it
may seem. In terms of understanding who the <i class="calibre4">adelphoi</i> of the Lord might
be, the discussion will center on the identity of “Mary of Clopas” and “James,
the Lord’s brother.”</p>
