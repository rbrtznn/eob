<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Because Paul Owen writes from a Western perspective, his
presentation quickly reveals the root of the difference between the Greek and
Latin perspectives:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Orthodox Christians believe that God is one
eternal, personal and spiritual divine substance who exists in three modes of
subsistence, or three self-distinctions.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Here, “Orthodox Christians” refers to ‘mainstream (Western)
Christians,’ not to the Eastern Orthodox. In fact, the authentic Eastern
Orthodox mind would disagree with the above statement which seems to confuse
“personal” and “substance.” The Greek Fathers would have written quite a
different summary, something along the lines of:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Orthodox Christians believe in one God the
Father, whose person is uncaused and unoriginate, who, because He is love and
communion, always exists with His Word and Spirit.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2826" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2826"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2826]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Our Western theologian continues with an equally problematic
statement:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Now when we come to the biblical evidence a
decision has to be made. Does one start with the assumption that God is one,
and then attempt to explain how God can be three; or does one begin with the
knowledge that God is three, and then attempt to explain in what way God can be
one? This decision is an important one, and as we will see, it is the basis of
important differences of understanding among Christians of different
traditions. Protestants and Roman Catholics, who tend to be under greater
influence from the heritage of the Western tradition, generally start with the
assumption of God’s oneness. The Eastern Orthodox Church on the other hand
follows the heritage of the East, and hence tends to begin with the knowledge
of God’s threeness… In the opinion of the present writer, the Western
tradition is correct to begin with the assumption of God’s oneness, and move
from there to an explanation of God’s threeness.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Orthodox Christians consider this statement to be
inaccurate: the Creed affirms “we believe in one God the Father… and in one
Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Spirit…” Hence, the Eastern Orthodox
tradition does start with God’s oneness, a oneness anchored in the person of
the Father.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Here, Paul Owen is siding with the Western affirmation that
the concept of the one substance (<i class="calibre4">ousia</i>) of God has priority over that
of person (<i class="calibre4">hypostastis</i>). The <i class="calibre4">Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> confirms:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Western tradition expresses first the
consubstantial communion between Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit
proceeds from the Father and the Son (Filioque)…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2827" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2827"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2827]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In his quotation of Hebrews 1:3, Paul Owen assumes that “being
the brightness of the glory and an exact representation of his essence” (<i class="calibre4">hos
on apaugasma tes doxes kai charakter tes hypostaseos autou</i>) means “exact
representation of the essential nature of God.” However, the Greek Orthodox
understanding leads to the conclusion that <i class="calibre4">hypostaseos </i>is better
translated as “person.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2828" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2828"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2828]</span></span></span></a></p>
