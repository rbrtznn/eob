<p class="msonormal1">Writing in the middle of the second century, Origen was
aware of at least two pre-existing texts which affirmed the Epiphanian view:
The so-called <i class="calibre4">Infancy Gospel of James</i><a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2882" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2882"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2882]</span></span></span></a>
(already mentioned) and the <i class="calibre4">Gospel of Peter</i>.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2883" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2883"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2883]</span></span></span></a>
We should also add to this list the <i class="calibre4">Infancy Gospel of Thomas</i>,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2884" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2884"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2884]</span></span></span></a>
the <i class="calibre4">Ascension of Isaiah</i><a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2885" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2885"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2885]</span></span></span></a>
and the <i class="calibre4">Odes of Solomon</i>. These early works are not heretical Gnostic
texts but belong to the Judeo-Christian tradition, which is why they were
widely respected in many early Churches. Origen and the Greek Fathers after him
felt that the story presented by the <i class="calibre4">Protevangelium of James</i> represented
a most likely account, especially on theological grounds.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This particular ‘proto-Gospel’ belongs to the so-called <i class="calibre4">pseudepigrapha</i>
and presents itself as a tradition from James himself. According to the story,
the Theotokos was miraculously conceived by Joachim and Anna in their old age,
after much prayer. She was entrusted to the priests to be raised in the Temple,
and one of her tasks was to participate in the weaving of the great curtain<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2886" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2886"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2886]</span></span></span></a>
which represented matter and more specifically the flesh of the Lord of Glory.
When she reached the age to leave the Temple, she was entrusted to Joseph who
was a <i class="calibre4">Tzadik</i>,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2887" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2887"><span class="msoendnotereference"><i class="calibre4"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2887]</span></b></span></i></span></a>
an older man, and the father of other children by his first marriage. Hence,
James ‘the Lord’s brother’ is presented as a step-brother of the Lord, which
seems to have been the view of Hegesippus and Eusebius.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This account makes perfect theological sense and is accepted
by Orthodox Christians as worthy of their pious belief.</p>
