with them, he commanded them, “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the promise
of the Father, which you heard from me. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Indeed, John baptized in
water, but not many days from now, you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Therefore, when they had come together, they
asked him, “Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Jesus told them, “It is not for you to know the times
or seasons which the Father has set by his own authority. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>However,
you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my
witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</p>

said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into the sky? This Jesus, who

a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where

<p class="sectiontopic">Peter’s sermon</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Men of Israel, listen to these words! Jesus of
Nazareth was a man attested to you by God by deeds of power and wonders as well
as signs which God accomplished through him in the midst of you, even as you
yourselves also know. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>He was handed over by the predetermined
counsel and foreknowledge of God, whom you have taken, and by the hands of the
wicked, have crucified and slain. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>God raised him up, having
released him from the pains of death, because it was impossible that he should
be held by it. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>For David says concerning him:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">I saw the Lord always before my face,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">For he is on my right hand, so that I should not be moved.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Therefore, my heart was glad and my tongue
rejoiced.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">Moreover, my flesh also will dwell in hope;</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>because you will not abandon my soul to
hades,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">neither will you allow your holy one to see decay.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>You made known to me the ways of life.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">You will make me full of gladness with your presence.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1304" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1304"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1304]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Brethren, I can tell you with confidence that
the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is with us even to this
day. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>But he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn with an oath
to him that from the fruit of his body, &lt;according to the flesh, God would

to sit on his throne. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>Foreseeing this, David spoke about the
resurrection of the Christ, [declaring] that his soul<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1306" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1306"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1306]</span></span></span></a>
would not be left in hades and that his flesh would not see decay. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>God
has raised this Jesus [back to life], and we are all witnesses of this fact. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>Being
therefore exalted by the right hand of God and having received from the Father
the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>For
David did not ascend into the heavens, but as he himself declared:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">The Lord said to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand,</p>

apostles, “Brethren, what shall we do?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">38</sup>Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized,
every one of you, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of sins, and
you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">39</sup>For the promise is
to you, and to your children, and to all who are far away, even as many as the
Lord our God will call to himself.” <sup class="calibre31">40</sup>With many other words, he was
bearing witness and urging them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked
generation!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">41</sup>Then those who gladly received his word were
baptized, and about three thousand souls were added on that day.</p>

with all, according to everyone’s need. <sup class="calibre31">46</sup>Day by day, they continued
[to meet] with one accord in the temple, and broke bread at home, partaking of
their food with gladness and simplicity of heart. <sup class="calibre31">47</sup>They praised God

<p class="sectiontopic">Stephen’s discourse </p>

<p class="style35ptloweredby1ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_7">7</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The high priest asked, “Are these things so?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify"><sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Stephen answered, “Brothers<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1350" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1350"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1350]</span></span></span></a>
and fathers, hear me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he
was [still] in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>And God said
to him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives, and come into a land which I will
show you.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1351" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1351"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1351]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">4</sup>This is how Abraham came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and
lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this
land, where you are now living. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>He gave Abraham no inheritance in
this land, no, not so much as to set his foot on it. But God had promised that
he and his descendants<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1352" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1352"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1352]</span></span></span></a>
would possess this land, even when Abraham was still childless. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>God
spoke in this way: that Abraham’s descendants would live as aliens in a foreign
land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>‘I
will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after
that [time], they will they come out and offer divine service<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1353" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1353"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1353]</span></span></span></a>
to me in this place.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1354" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1354"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1354]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">8</sup>God also gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. Then Abraham
became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac became
the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the Twelve patriarchs.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Filled with jealousy against Joseph, the
patriarchs sold him into Egypt, but God was with him. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>He delivered
Joseph<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1355" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1355"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1355]</span></span></span></a>
from all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, the king
of Egypt. Pharaoh appointed him governor over Egypt and his entire house. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Now
a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, along with great
suffering, and our fathers<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1356" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1356"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1356]</span></span></span></a>
could not find any food. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>But when Jacob heard that there was grain
in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on a first visit. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>On their
second visit, Joseph was revealed to his brothers and Pharaoh learned about
Joseph’s family. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Joseph sent [a message] and called for his father
Jacob as well as all his relatives (seventy-five<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1357" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1357"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1357]</span></span></span></a>
souls). <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>So Jacob went down into Egypt where he died, along with
our fathers. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Later, they were brought back to Shechem and laid in
the tomb that Abraham had purchased for a price in silver from the children of
Hamor of Shechem.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>As the time of the promise which God had sworn
to Abraham came close, the people were growing and multiplying in Egypt. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Then
a different king, one who did not know Joseph, came to power there. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>This
king took advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers, forcing them to
abandon their babies, so that they would not stay alive. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>At that
time, Moses was born, and he was pleasing to God. For three months, he was
nourished in his father’s house; <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>and when he was thrown out,
Pharaoh’s daughter took him and raised him as her own son. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Moses
was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his
words and actions. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>But when he was forty years old, it came into
his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Seeing
one of them treated unjustly, he defended and avenged a man who was oppressed,
striking the Egyptian. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>He supposed that his brethren would understand
that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance;<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1358" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1358"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1358]</span></span></span></a>
but they did not understand.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>The following day, Moses presented himself to
them as they were quarreling and urged them to be at peace again, saying, ‘Men,
you are brothers! Why do you wrong each other?’ <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>But the man who
was mistreating the other pushed Moses away, saying: ‘Who made you a ruler and
a judge over us? <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Do you want to kill me, as you killed the
Egyptian yesterday?’<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1359" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1359"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1359]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">29</sup>When he heard this, Moses fled and became a stranger in the land of
Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">30</sup>When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of
the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire
in a bush. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>When Moses saw it, he wondered<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1360" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1360"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1360]</span></span></span></a>
at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,
[saying], <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1361" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1361"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1361]</span></span></span></a>
Moses trembled and did not dare to look. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>The Lord said to him,
‘Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy
ground. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>I have indeed seen the affliction of my people in Egypt
and heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will
send you into Egypt.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1362" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1362"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1362]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">35</sup>This Moses, whom they had rejected by saying:
‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’—God sent as both a ruler and a deliverer by
the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>Having
worked wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, this man led them out in the Red
Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. <sup class="calibre31">37</sup>It is that [same] Moses
who said to the children of Israel, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a
prophet like me from among your brethren; <a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1363" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1363"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1363]</span></span></span></a>you

<sup class="calibre31">38</sup>It is this Moses who was in the assembly<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1365" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1365"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1365]</span></span></span></a>
in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our
fathers, receiving living oracles to give to us. <sup class="calibre31">39</sup>But our fathers
would not be obedient to him; they rejected him and in their heart, turned back
to Egypt. <sup class="calibre31">40</sup>They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods that will go before us!
As for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has
become of him.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1366" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1366"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1366]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">41</sup>They made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the
idol, rejoicing in the works of their hands. <sup class="calibre31">42</sup>But God turned [away]
and gave them up to offer divine service to the host of heaven,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1367" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1367"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1367]</span></span></span></a>
as it is written in the book of the prophets:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Did you offer me slain animals and sacrifices</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">[during the] forty years in the wilderness, O house of
Israel?</p>

beyond Babylon.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">44</sup>Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony
in the wilderness, which he who had spoken to Moses had commanded him to build
according to the pattern that he had seen. <sup class="calibre31">45</sup>It was handed down to
our fathers, and in turn, they brought it with Joshua when they entered into
the possession of the nations which God drove out before the face of our
fathers. This tabernacle was there until the days of David, <sup class="calibre31">46</sup>who
found favor in the sight of God, and who prayed to find a habitation for the
God of Jacob. <sup class="calibre31">47</sup>Yet, it was Solomon who built him a house. <sup class="calibre31">48</sup>However,
the Most High does not dwell in sanctuaries made with hands, as the prophet
says:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst"><sup class="calibre31">49</sup>‘Heaven is my throne,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">and the earth is a footstool for my feet.</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">What kind of house will you build for me?’ says the Lord;</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">‘or what is the place of my rest?’</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">50</sup>Did not my hand make all these things?<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1370" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1370"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1370]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Stephen’s martyrdom—His vision</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">54</sup>Now when they heard these things, they were
furious and gnashed their teeth at him. <sup class="calibre31">55</sup>But Stephen, full of the

opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">57</sup>At this, they shouted with a loud voice,
blocking their ears, and rushed at him with one accord. <sup class="calibre31">58</sup>So they
threw him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments
at the feet of a young man named Saul. <sup class="calibre31">59</sup>As they were stoning

were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except

over him. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>In the meantime, Saul was ravaging the Church, entering
into every house and dragging both men and women off to prison. </p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Philip in Samaria—Simon the sorcerer</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>As a result, those who had been scattered abroad
began to travel around, preaching the word. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Philip went down to the
city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>When the people heard
and saw the signs which Philip was accomplishing, they agreed to listen to what
he was preaching. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>(Indeed, unclean spirits were expelled from many
of those who had them, and they came out shouting with a loud voice. Many who
had been paralyzed and lame were healed, <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>and there was great joy in
that city).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who
used to practice sorcery in the city. He amazed the people of Samaria, claiming
to be a great one, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>and all listened to him, from the least to the
greatest. They said, “This man is the great power of God!” <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>People
listened to him because for a long time, he had amazed them with his sorceries.
<sup class="calibre31">12</sup>But when they believed Philip [who was] preaching good tidings,
the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the Name of Jesus Christ, they
were baptized, both men and women. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Simon himself also believed and

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Simon answered, “Pray for me to God, that none

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">25</sup>After Peter and John had borne witness and

Hellenists and preached the Lord Jesus when they arrived in Antioch. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>The
hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the

he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced. He encouraged them all to
remain close to the Lord with a resolute heart. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Indeed, Barnabas

they lived as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led

distributed their land among them by lot. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>After this, for about

so, he began to debate in the synagogue with the Jews and the [Gentile]
God-fearers, and every day in the marketplace with the people that he met. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Some
of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also had discussions with him. Some
said, “What is this babbler trying to say?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Others suggested, “He seems to be advocating foreign
deities,” because he was preaching to them Jesus and [Anastasin] ‘the

is all about? <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>You certainly bring some strange things to our ears!
Therefore we want to know what all this is about.” <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Now all the

but either to tell or to hear some new thing.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>So Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus,

in ignorance, this one I announce to you! <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>The God who made the
world and all things in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in
sanctuaries made with hands! <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Neither is he served by human hands,
as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all life, breath, and
everything else. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>From one blood<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1478" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1478"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1478]</span></span></span></a>,
he has made every nation to dwell on the entire surface of the earth (having

and perhaps reach out for him and find him, although he is not far from each
one of us. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>‘For in him we live, and move, and have our being!’ As
some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1480" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1480"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1480]</span></span></span></a>

is like gold, silver, or stone, engraved by human art and imagination. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>In
the past, God overlooked such ignorance, but now, he commands that all people
everywhere should repent, <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>because he has appointed a day in which
he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained. He
has given assurance of this to all by raising him from the dead.”</p>

[a man] devoted to God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Now
Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his entire

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>But when Paul was about to open his mouth,
Gallio said to the Jews, “If you Jews were complaining about a matter of
wrongdoing or about a wicked crime, it would be reasonable that I should bear
with you. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>However, if there is a question about words and names

the Jews. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he
declined. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>However, taking his leave of them, he said, “I must by

Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to receive him.

debating and presenting arguments concerning the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But when some became hardened and disobedient,
they began to speak evil of the Way in public. Then Paul departed from them and

that they escaped from that house naked and wounded. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>This became
known to all who lived at Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. Fear fell upon them
all, and the Name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>And many of
those who had believed came forward to confess and reveal their [evil] deeds. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Many
of those who practiced magical arts brought their books and burned them in the

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">36</sup>After saying these things, Paul knelt down and

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_21">21</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">After departing from them, we set sail and made a straight
course to Cos. The next day, [we sailed] to Rhodes and from there to Patara. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Having
found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and continued our journey.
<sup class="calibre31">3</sup>When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we
sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre where the ship was to unload her cargo. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Since
we found some disciples there, we stayed for seven days. Through the Spirit,
the disciples told Paul that he should not go up to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>When
our time there was completed, we departed and went on our journey. All the
disciples, with wives and children, escorted us on our way until we were out of
the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>After saying
goodbye to each other, we boarded the ship and they returned home.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>We continued the voyage from Tyre and arrived in
Ptolemais. There, we greeted the brethren and spent the day with them. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>The

left and arrived in Caesarea.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">We went to the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one
of the seven, and stayed with him. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Now this man had four virgin
daughters who prophesied. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>As we stayed there for a few days, a
prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Coming to us and taking
Paul’s belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, “Thus says the Holy
Spirit: ‘Likewise, in Jerusalem, the Jews will bind the man who owns this belt
and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>When we heard these things, both we and the
disciples who lived there begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Then
Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? Indeed, I am
ready, not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the Name of the
Lord Jesus.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Since he would not be persuaded, we became
silent, except to say, “The Lord’s will be done!”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul visits James in Jerusalem</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>After these days, we took up our baggage and
went up to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Some of the disciples from Caesarea also
went with us, bringing an early disciple [named] Mnason of Cyprus, with whom we
would be staying.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren
received us gladly. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>The next day, Paul went with us to visit
James, and all the presbyters<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1509" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1509"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1509]</span></span></span></a>
were present. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>After greeting them, Paul reported in detail what
God had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>When
they heard it, they glorified the Lord. They told him, “You see, brother, that
there are many thousands among the Jews who have believed, and they are all
zealous for the law. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>They have been informed about you, that you
teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to abandon Moses and that you
tell them not to circumcise their children or to preserve the customs. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>What
then? The Church must certainly meet since they will hear that you have
arrived. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Therefore, do what we tell you. We have four men who have
taken a vow. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Take them, join in their purification rites, and pay
for their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Then all may know that
there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself also live
in observance of the law. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>But concerning the Gentiles who believe,
we have written our decision &lt;that they should observe no such thing,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1510" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1510"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1510]</span></span></span></a>
except&gt; that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from
blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>So Paul took the men, and the next day, he
purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment
of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of
them. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>When the seven days were almost completed, Jews from Asia
saw Paul in the temple. They stirred up the entire crowd and laid hands on him,
<sup class="calibre31">28</sup>shouting, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all
men everywhere against the {chosen} people, the law, and this place. Moreover,
he also brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place!” <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>[They
said this] because they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with Paul in the city,
and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul is arrested</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">30</sup>The entire city was in turmoil and the people
came running. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once
the doors were shut. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>As they were trying to kill him, news came up

of the [Roman] troops that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>Immediately,
he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to the crowd. When they saw the
chief captain and the soldiers, the Jews<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1512" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1512"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1512]</span></span></span></a>
stopped beating Paul. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>Then the commanding officer came near and
arrested him. He gave orders that Paul should be bound with two chains, and
inquired who he was and what he had done. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>From the crowd, some
shouted one thing and some another. Since the commander could not find out the
truth because of the noise, he commanded that Paul be taken into the barracks.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">35</sup>When Paul reached the steps, he was carried by
the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>The whole mob
followed them and shouted, “Away with him!” <sup class="calibre31">37</sup>As Paul was about to
be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, “May I speak to
you?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The man said, “Do you know Greek? <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>Then are you
not the Egyptian who recently stirred people up to rebellion and led the four
thousand Assassins into the wilderness?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">39</sup>So Paul replied, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in
Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1513" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1513"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1513]</span></span></span></a>
I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">40</sup>Having received permission from the commander,
Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand to the people. When there
was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1514" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1514"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1514]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_22">22</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">“Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now
make to you.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">2</sup>When the people heard that he was addressing
them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Paul continued, <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>“I am indeed a Jew, born in
Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel. I was
instructed according to the strict tradition of the law of our fathers, being
zealous for God, even as you all are this day. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>I persecuted this
Way to death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, as <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>the
high priest and the entire council of the presbyters can testify. I even
received letters for their brethren in Damascus and traveled there to bring
these people in chains to Jerusalem to be punished. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>It happened
that, suddenly, as I was on my journey and approaching Damascus, at about noon,
a great light shone from the sky<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1515" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1515"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1515]</span></span></span></a>
around me. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul,
Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’
He said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.’</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Indeed, those who were with me saw the light and
were afraid<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1516" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1516"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1516]</span></span></span></a>,
but they did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>I
asked, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me, ‘Arise, and go into
Damascus. There, you will be told what you should do.’ <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Since I
could not see because of the glory of that light, I was led by the hand of
those who were with me and arrived in Damascus. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Someone named
Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews, and
who lived in Damascus, came to me.<sup class="calibre31"> 13</sup>Standing by me, he said,
‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ At that very moment, I was able to see him!
<sup class="calibre31">14</sup>He said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his
will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>For
you will be a witness for him to all people, testifying to what you have seen
and heard. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away
your sins, calling on the Name of the Lord.’</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>It happened that, when I had returned to
Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>I
saw the Lord<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1517" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1517"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1517]</span></span></span></a>
saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not

your testimony concerning me.’ <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know
that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>When

Stephen was shed, I too was standing by, consenting to his death and guarding
the coats of those who killed him.’</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Then he said to me, ‘Depart, for I will send
you out far from here to the Gentiles.’”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>They listened to him until he said that; then
they lifted up their voice, and shouted, “Rid the earth of this fellow, for he
is not fit to live!”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul is arrested—His Roman citizenship</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>As they were shouting and throwing off their
cloaks and dust into the air, <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>the commanding officer ordered that
Paul be brought into the barracks. He [then] gave instruction that Paul should
be interrogated under scourging, so that he might find out for what crime the
people shouted against him in such a way. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>When they had tied him
up with straps, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, “Is it lawful for you to
flog a man who is a Roman [citizen] and uncondemned?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>When the centurion heard this, he went to the
commanding officer and told him, “Take care what you do, for this man is a
Roman [citizen]!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Then the commanding officer came and asked Paul,
“Tell me, are you a Roman?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Paul replied, “Yes.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>The commanding officer answered, “I bought my

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"> “But I was born a Roman,” Paul replied.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Immediately those who were about to interrogate
him left him, and even the commanding officer was afraid when he realized that
he had bound Paul, a Roman [citizen], in chains. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>But on the next
day, desiring to know the truth about why Paul<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1520" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1520"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1520]</span></span></span></a>

freed him from the bonds and commanded the chief priests and all their

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul before the Sanhedrin</p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_23">23</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Looking straight at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, “Brothers, I
have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.” <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Then
Ananias, the high priest, ordered those who stood by him to strike Paul on the
mouth.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>At this, Paul said to him, “God will strike you,
you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and [yet]
command me to be struck contrary to the law?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Those who stood by said, “Do you insult God’s
high priest?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he
was high priest. For it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of
your people.’”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1522" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1522"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1522]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But when Paul realized that some were Sadducees and the others
Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the
son of a Pharisee! And I am being judged concerning the hope and resurrection
of the dead!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>When he said this, an argument arose between the
Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>(For the
Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, angel, or spirit; but the
Pharisees believe in all of these things). <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>A great uproar began,
and the teachers of the law who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood
up. They strongly argued, “We find no evil in this man! But if a spirit or
angel has spoken to him, <a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1523" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1523"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1523]</span></span></span></a>let

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>The dispute became so fierce that the commanding
officer feared that they would tear Paul to pieces. He then ordered the
soldiers to go down and remove Paul from the assembly by force, and to bring
him into the barracks.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>The following night, the Lord stood by him, and
said, “Rejoice, Paul! As you have borne witness to me in Jerusalem, you must also
bear witness in Rome.”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Conspiracy exposed—Paul is taken to Caesarea</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>When day came, some of the Jews banded together
and bound themselves under a great curse,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1524" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1524"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1524]</span></span></span></a>
saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>There
were more than forty people who joined this conspiracy. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>They came
to the chief priests and the presbyters, and said, “We have bound ourselves
under a great curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Now
then, you with the Sanhedrin should petition the commanding officer to bring
him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>But Paul’s nephew<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1525" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1525"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1525]</span></span></span></a>
heard of their ambush. He came, entered into the fortress and told Paul. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Calling
one of the centurions, Paul said, “Bring this young man to the commanding

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Accordingly, the centurion took Paul’s nephew<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1526" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1526"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1526]</span></span></span></a>
and brought him to the commanding officer, saying, “Paul, the prisoner, called
me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>The commanding officer took Paul’s nephew by
the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, “What is it that you have to
tell me?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>He replied, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to
bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire
somewhat more accurately concerning him. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>But do not give in to
their request, for more than forty men lie in wait for Paul, and they have
bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have
killed him. They are ready now, waiting for you to grant their request.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>And so, the commanding officer let the young

to me.” <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>He called to himself two of the centurions and said, “Prepare
two hundred soldiers to leave at the third hour of the night<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1527" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1527"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1527]</span></span></span></a>
for Caesarea, along with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with
spears.” <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>He asked them to provide animals in order set Paul on
one, and to bring him safely to Felix the governor. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>He wrote a
letter as follows:</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6 ml-0-25in"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>“Claudius Lysias to

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6 ml-0-25in"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>This man was seized
by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers
and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman [citizen]. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Desiring
to know why they accused him, I brought him to their council. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>I
found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with
anything worthy of death or imprisonment. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>When I was told that the
Jews were about to ambush this man, I immediately sent him to you. I also
instructed his accusers to bring their accusations against him before you.

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">31</sup>And so the soldiers, carrying out their orders,
took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>But on the next
day, they left the horsemen to continue with him and returned to the barracks. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>When
the horsemen<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1529" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1529"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1529]</span></span></span></a>
arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and also
presented Paul to him. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>After reading the letter, the governor
asked what province Paul was from. Having learned that he was from Cilicia, he
said, <sup class="calibre31">35</sup>“I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive.” He
then commanded that Paul should be held in Herod’s palace.</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_24">24</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Five days later, the high priest, Ananias, came down with
the presbyters and a professional speaker<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1530" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1530"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1530]</span></span></span></a>
named Tertullus, and they informed the governor of their charges against Paul. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Paul
was then called in and Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “We have enjoyed
much peace under you, and we see that prosperity<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1531" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1531"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1531]</span></span></span></a>
is being carried out for this nation. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Most Excellent Felix, we
acknowledge this always and everywhere, with utmost gratitude. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>But,
that I may not delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>As
it is, we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections
among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the
Nazarenes. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>&lt;He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested
him, <a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1532" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1532"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1532]</span></span></span></a>desiring
to judge him according to our own laws. <sup class="calibre31">7<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1533" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1533"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre82">[1533]</span></span></span></a></sup>However,
the commanding officer, Lysias, arrived and with much violence took him out of
our hands, <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him
yourself, you will be able to verify for yourself the truth of our
accusations.”&gt;</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>The Jews also joined in the deposition,
affirming that these things were true. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>When the governor had
motioned for him to speak, Paul answered, “Because I know that you have been a
judge of this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>As
you can see, it has been no more than twelve days since I went up to express
adoration<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1534" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1534"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1534]</span></span></span></a>
at Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>In the temple, they did not find me disputing with
anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Moreover,
they cannot prove the accusations they are making against me now. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>However,
I do admit this to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so do
I offer divine service to the God of our fathers. I believe all things which
are written in the law and in the prophets. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>I have the same hope
in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both upright
and wicked. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>And so, I strive also to always have a conscience
without offense toward God and men. </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Now after a few years, I came to bring to my
people gifts for the needy, and to present offerings. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>This is how
certain Jews from Asia found me in the temple, ritually purified, with no mob
or turmoil. But there are some Jews from Asia <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>who should have been
here before you to present their accusations if they had anything against me. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Otherwise,
let these men explain what injustice they found in me when I stood before the
Sanhedrin. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Or perhaps it is for what I cried out while standing
among them, ‘I am being judged by you today regarding the resurrection of the
dead!’”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>But when Felix heard these things, being better
informed concerning the Way, he adjourned the case, stating, “When Lysias, the
commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s years in Caesarea</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>He ordered the centurion that Paul should be
kept in custody and that he should have some privileges: none of his friends
should be forbidden from serving him or visiting him. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>A few days
later, Felix came with his wife Drusilla who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and
granted him a hearing concerning the faith in Christ. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>As Paul
discoursed about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix
became alarmed and said, “Go your way for now. When it is convenient for me, I
will summon you [again].” <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Meanwhile, he also hoped that Paul would
offer him money for his release. For this reason too, he sent for him more
often and discussed with him. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>But after two years had elapsed,
Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the
Jews, Felix left Paul imprisoned.</p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_25">25</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up to
Jerusalem from Caesarea. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Then the high priest and the leaders of
the Jewish people presented to him an [accusatory] report against Paul. They
begged him <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>and asked for his support against Paul, asking that he

[back] to Jerusalem, plotting to kill him on the way. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>However,
Festus replied that Paul would be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he
himself would leave shortly. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>He said, “Those who have authority
among you should go down [there] with me! And if this man has done anything
wrong, let them accuse him.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Having stayed among them more than ten<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1536" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1536"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1536]</span></span></span></a>

to Caesarea. The following day, he sat on the judgment seat and ordered that
Paul be brought in. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>When he arrived, the Jews who had traveled from
Jerusalem stood around [him]. They hurled against Paul many grave accusations
which they could not prove. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Paul then said in his [own] defense, “I
have not sinned in any way, against the law of the Jews, or against the temple,
or against Caesar!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Then desiring to gain favor with the Jews,
Festus asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem in order to be judged
by me there concerning these matters?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But Paul replied, “I am standing before
Caesar’s judgment seat, where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the
Jews, as you also know very well. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Now if I have done wrong and
committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die! But if none of
those things they accuse me of are true, then no one can hand me over to them.
I appeal to Caesar!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>At this, and after conferring with his
advisers, Festus answered, “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall
go!”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul before King Agrippa</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>A few days later, King Agrippa and Bernice
arrived in Caesarea to greet Festus. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Since they were spending many
days there, Festus presented Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a
certain man who was left as a prisoner by Felix. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>When I was in
Jerusalem, the chief priests and the presbyters of the Jews presented an
[accusatory] report about this man, asking me to condemn him. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>I
answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to condemn anyone to
death<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1538" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1538"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1538]</span></span></span></a>
before the accused has met his accusers face to face and has had opportunity to
make his defense in the case against him. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Then, since they had
come together here, I did not delay. On the following day, I sat on the
judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>When the
accusers stood up, they did not bring any of the charges I was expecting. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Instead,
they had some dispute against him dealing with their own religion, and about a
certain Jesus who was dead, and whom Paul affirmed to be alive. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>I
was puzzled as how to investigate such things and asked whether he was willing
to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>But
Paul appealed that his case be reserved for the decision of the emperor, and so
I gave orders that he be detained until I could send him to Caesar.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Agrippa said to Festus, “I too would like to
hear this man!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">“Tomorrow,” Festus replied, “you shall hear him.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>On the next day, after Agrippa and Bernice had
made their entry with great pomp, they went to the audience hall with the
commanding officers and the leaders of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul
was brought in. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all who are here
present with us, you see this man. The entire Jewish community, both in
Jerusalem and here, petitioned me about him, clamoring that he should not live
any longer. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy
of death, and as he himself had appealed to his Imperial Majesty, I decided to
send him {to Rome}. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>I have nothing certain to write to my lord
concerning this man! Therefore, I have brought him forth before you [all], and
especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after examination, I may have
something to write. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>For it seems unreasonable to me to send a
prisoner without also specifying the charges against him.”</p>

<p class="style37ptbefore0ptloweredby6ptlinespacingexactl" id="toc_26">26</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Agrippa said to Paul, “You may speak for yourself.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify">Then Paul held up his hand and made
his defense. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>“I consider myself blessed, King Agrippa, that today,
I am able to make my defense before you in response to all the accusations of
the Jews, <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>especially because you are an expert in all the customs
and debates which take place among the Jews. Therefore, I beg you to hear me
patiently.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Indeed, all the Jews know about my way of life
from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Since
they have known me from the beginning, they could testify that I lived as a
Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>And now,
I stand here on trial because of the hope of the promise made by God to the
fathers! <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>This is what our twelve tribes hope to attain as they
constantly offer divine service<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1539" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1539"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1539]</span></span></span></a>
night and day. It is concerning this hope that I am accused by the Jews, King
Agrippa! <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Why is it judged incredible that God raises the dead?</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>As for myself, I certainly thought that it was
my duty to oppose the Name of Jesus of Nazareth. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>I also did this
in Jerusalem: having received authority from the chief priests, I had many of the
saints imprisoned, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against
them. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Often I went to all the synagogues to have them punished and
I tried to make them blaspheme. Filled with rage against them, I even
persecuted them in foreign cities.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Then, as I was traveling to Damascus with the
authority and commission from the chief priests, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>at noon, O king,
I saw on the way a light from the sky.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1540" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1540"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1540]</span></span></span></a>
It was brighter than the sun and shone around me and those who were traveling
with me. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking
to me and saying in the Hebrew<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1541" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1541"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1541]</span></span></span></a>
language, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick
against the goads!’</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1542" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1542"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1542]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">He replied, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting! <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Now
arise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to
appoint you as a servant and a witness both of what you have seen and of what I
will reveal to you. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>I will rescue you from the [Jewish] people and
from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>to open their eyes, so
that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, and
receive remission of sins as well as an inheritance among those who are
sanctified by faith in me.’</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient
to the heavenly vision, <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>but I proclaimed this to the people of
Damascus first, and Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea. Then I
also proclaimed it to the Gentiles—that they should repent, turn to God, and do
works worthy of [their] repentance. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>For this reason, the Jews
arrested me in the temple and tried to kill me. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Yet, having
obtained God’s help, I stand to this day and bear witness to small and great
alike. I only say what the prophets and Moses said would happen, <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>how
the Christ was {destined} to suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead,
he would be first to proclaim light both to the [Jewish] people and to the
Gentiles.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>As Paul was presenting this defense, Festus
exclaimed with a loud voice, “Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is
driving you insane!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">25</sup>But Paul replied, “I am not crazy, Most
Excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and good sense. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Indeed,
the king is aware of these things and I will also speak freely to him. For I am
convinced that none of this is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a
corner. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you
believe!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Agrippa then said to Paul, “With a little
persuasion, are you trying to make me a Christian?”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1543" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1543"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1543]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Paul answered, “I pray to God, that whether
with little or with much, not only you but also all who hear me today might
become as I am, except for these chains.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">30</sup>When he had said these things,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1544" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1544"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1544]</span></span></span></a>
the king rose up with the governor, along with Bernice and those who sat with
them. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>After retiring, they talked together and agreed, “This man
has done nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.” <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>Agrippa said to
Festus, “This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”</p>

delivered Paul and other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Imperial
regiment. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Boarding a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, intending
to sail to various places on the coast of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of
Thessalonica, traveled with us. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>The next day, we landed at Sidon.
Julius treated Paul with kindness and gave him permission to visit his friends
and to be cared for. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Putting to sea from there, we sailed under
[the shelter of] Cyprus because the winds were contrary. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>After
sailing across the open sea along [the coasts of] Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
arrived in Myra,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1546" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1546"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1546]</span></span></span></a>
a city of Lycia. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>There, the centurion found a ship sailing from
Alexandria to Italy, and he put us on board. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>After sailing slowly
for many days, we arrived with difficulty near Cnidus. The wind did not allow
us to go further [on course], and we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off
Salmone. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>We continued along the coast and arrived at a place called
‘Fair Havens,’ near the city of Lasea.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>A great deal of time had been lost and the

was already past. Paul gave them this warning: <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>“Sirs, I perceive
that the voyage will result in injuries and much loss, not only of the cargo
and ship, but also of our lives!” <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>However, the centurion gave more
heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul was saying. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Since
the haven was not suitable to spend the winter, the majority was in favor of
continuing, doing their utmost to reach Phoenix and winter there. This is a
port of Crete which faces both the northeast and the southeast.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>When the south wind began to blow softly, they
thought that their goal was within reach. Having lifted the anchor, they sailed
along [the coast of] Crete, close to shore. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>But before long, a

<sup class="calibre31">15</sup>The ship was caught and could not face the wind. We had to yield
to the wind, and the ship was driven along. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Sailing under the
shelter of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to
secure the lifeboat. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>After the crew had hoisted it up, they used
it to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the
Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship drift along. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>We
were so battered by the storm that the next day, the men began to throw things
overboard. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>On the third day, we threw out the ship’s tackle with
our own hands. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>When neither sun nor stars had shone on us for many
days, and with a major storm pressing on us, all hope that we would be saved
was now taken away.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>As the men had been for a long time without
food, Paul stood up among them and said, “Sirs, you should have listened to me
and not have set sail from Crete; then you would have avoided this injury and
loss. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Now I encourage you to keep your courage, for there will be
no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>For last night,
an angel of the God to whom I belong and to whom I offer divine service<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1550" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1550"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1550]</span></span></span></a>
stood by me. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>He said: ‘Do not be afraid, Paul! You must stand
before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you [the life of] all those who sail
with you.’ <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer! For I believe God,
that it will be just as it has been spoken to me. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>However, we must
run aground on some island.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>On the fourteenth night, at about midnight, as
we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, the sailors surmised that
they were approaching some land. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>They measured the depth of water
and found twenty fathoms.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1551" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1551"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1551]</span></span></span></a>
A little while later, they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1552" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1552"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1552]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let down
four anchors from the stern, hoping to hold steady until daylight. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Trying
to escape from the ship, the sailors lowered the lifeboat into the sea, pretending
that they would lay out anchors from the bow. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>Paul then said to
the centurion and to the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you
cannot be saved!” <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>So the soldiers cut away the ropes of the
lifeboat and let it fall off.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">33</sup>As the day was coming on, Paul begged them all
to take some food, saying, “This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and
continue fasting, taking nothing. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>Now I urge you to take some
food! This is for your safety, and not a hair will fall from any of your
heads.” <sup class="calibre31">35</sup>After saying this and having taken bread, he gave thanks
to God in the presence of all. Then he broke it and began to eat. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>At
this, they all cheered up and also took food. <sup class="calibre31">37</sup>In all, we were two
hundred seventy-six souls on the ship. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>When they had eaten enough,
they lightened the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea. <sup class="calibre31">39</sup>When
day came, they did not recognize the land but noticed a cove with a beach, and
they decided to try to drive the ship onto it. <sup class="calibre31">40</sup>Casting off the
anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes.
Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. <sup class="calibre31">41</sup>But
coming to a place with cross-currents,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1553" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1553"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1553]</span></span></span></a>
they beached the vessel. The front of the ship struck and remained immovable
while the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">42</sup>The soldiers’ advice was to kill the prisoners,
so that none of them would swim out and escape. <sup class="calibre31">43</sup>But the centurion,
desiring to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He gave orders
that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first and go to
shore. <sup class="calibre31">44</sup>The rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other
things from the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to the land.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">In Malta—Paul bitten by a snake</p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_28">28</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Once safe on the shore, they learned that the island was
called Malta. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>The natives showed us unusual kindness; they kindled
a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>But as
Paul was gathering a bundle of sticks and placing them on the fire, a viper
came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>When
the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, “There
is no doubt that this man is a murderer! He has escaped from the sea but
Justice has not allowed him to live.” <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>However, Paul shook off the
creature into the fire and remained unharmed. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Nevertheless, they
expected that he would have swollen or suddenly fallen down dead. After
watching for a long time and seeing nothing bad happen to him, they changed
their minds and said that he was a god!</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Now in the vicinity of that place were lands
belonging to the leader of the island, [a man] named Publius who welcomed us
and courteously hosted us for three days. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>It also happened that
Publius’ father was bedridden, sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went to see
him and prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>After this
had taken place, the rest of the people who had diseases in the island also
came, and they were cured. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>They honored us in many ways; and when
we sailed off, they put on board the things that we needed.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Three months later, we set sail in a ship from
Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose figurehead was “The Twin
Brothers.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1554" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1554"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1554]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>From
there, we circled around [the coastline of Sicily] and arrived at Rhegium. The
following day, a south wind sprang up and on the second day, we arrived in
Puteoli. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>There, we found brethren who entreated us to stay with
them for seven days. And so, we approached Rome.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Arrival in Rome</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>From there, having heard of us, the brethren
came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and the Three Taverns. When Paul
saw them, he thanked God and took courage. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>&lt;When we reached
Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1555" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1555"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1555]</span></span></span></a>
but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.&gt;</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Three days later, Paul called together those
who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, he said to them, “Brothers,
although I have done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1556" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1556"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1556]</span></span></span></a>
I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>After
putting me on trial, the Romans wanted to release me because there were no
grounds to put me to death. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>But when the Jews spoke against it, I
was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse
my nation. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>For this reason, therefore, I asked to see you and to
speak with you, for it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with
this chain.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>They answered him, “We have not received
letters from Judea concerning you, and no brother has come here to make a
report or speak any evil of you. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>But we desire to hear from you
what you think because it is known to us that everywhere, people speak against
this sect.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>After making an appointment with Paul for a
certain day, many more people visited him at his place of residence. From
morning until evening, he explained and bore witness about [the things of] the
Kingdom of God. He also tried to convince the Jews<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1557" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1557"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1557]</span></span></span></a>
concerning Jesus, [quoting] both from the law of Moses and from the prophets. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Some
believed what was spoken, and others did not. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Although disagreeing
among themselves, they left after Paul had spoken one [last] word, “Rightly did
the Holy Spirit speak to our fathers through Isaias (Isaiah) the prophet, <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>saying:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Go to this people and say:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">You will keep on hearing but never understand!</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">You will keep on seeing but never perceive!</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>For this people’s heart has grown callous,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">Their ears are dull of hearing,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">And they have closed their eyes,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">For fear that they should see with their eyes, hear with
their ears,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">Understand with their heart, and would repent,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">And I would heal them.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1558" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1558"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1558]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Therefore, you should know that God’s salvation
is sent to the nations; they will listen!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>&lt;After Paul said these words, the Jews
departed with a great dispute among themselves.&gt;<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1559" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1559"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1559]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">30</sup>So Paul stayed two whole years in his own
rented house, receiving everyone who came to visit him. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>With all
boldness and without hindrance, he proclaimed the Kingdom of God and taught
about the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
