<p class="msonormal1">Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ;</p>

<p class="msonormal2">To all the saints in Christ Jesus who
are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Grace to you and
peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>I give
thanks to my God whenever I remember you, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>and I always pray with
joy when I intercede on your behalf <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>because of your partnership<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1965" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1965"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1965]</span></span></span></a>
in the furtherance of the Good News, even from the very first day until now. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>I
am confident of this very thing: that God<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1966" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1966"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1966]</span></span></span></a>
who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>It
is right for me to think this way about you, because I have you in my heart and
because you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in
the defense and confirmation of the Good News. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>For <span class="calibre27">God is my witness: I long for all of you in the
tender mercies of Jesus Christ!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre27">9</span></sup><span class="calibre27">I pray [especially] for this, that your love may
overflow even more, with an increase of knowledge and all discernment. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>This
way, you will be able to discern what things are excellent, so that you may be
sincere and without offense until the day of Christ, <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>filled with
the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and
praise of God!</span></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The progress of the Good News</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Now I want you to know, brethren, that what
happened to me has turned out to be for the progress of the Good News! <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>It
became clear to the whole palace<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1967" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1967"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1967]</span></span></span></a>
guard and to others that my chains are in Christ, <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>and most of the
brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are even bolder to
speak the word without fear. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Yes, some actually preach Christ out
of envy and rivalry, and some also out of good will. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>The first<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1968" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1968"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1968]</span></span></span></a>
[group] preaches Christ without sincerity and from selfish ambition, thinking that
they are adding affliction to my imprisonment; <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>but the second
[group] does so out of love, knowing that I have been appointed to defend the
Good News.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Either way, it does not matter. I only care
that whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed! I rejoice in this,
yes, and will continue to rejoice, <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>because I know that this will
turn out for my salvation, through your supplication and the support of
Christ’s Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>It is my eager expectation and hope that I will
not be put to shame in any way, but that as I speak with all boldness, Christ
will be exalted now as always in my body, whether by my life or by my death. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>For
to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>But if I remain alive
in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work. Yet, I do not know what I
will choose! <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire
to be released<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1969" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1969"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1969]</span></span></span></a>
and be with Christ, which is far better. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>At the same time, to
remain in the flesh is a more urgent need for your sake. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Having
this confidence, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for
your progress and joy in faith, <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>so that your rejoicing may
overflow in Christ Jesus when I am with you again.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>[In the meantime], let your way of life be
worthy of the Good News of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain
absent, I may hear this about your condition: that you stand firm in one
spirit, striving with one soul for the faith of the Good News. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>Do
not be terrified by your opponents. This will be for them evidence of
destruction, but to you, of salvation from God. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>For the sake of
Christ, you have been granted the privilege not only to believe in him but also
to suffer on his behalf, <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>and so you are engaged in the same battle
which you saw me fight and that you hear that I am [still] fighting.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1970" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1970"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1970]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">A call to humility</p>

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-2" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Therefore, if there is any exhortation in Christ, any
consolation of love, any communion of the Spirit, any tender mercies and compassion,
<sup class="calibre31">2</sup>make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being
of one accord and of one mind. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Do nothing through rivalry or
conceit, but in humility, consider others better than yourselves. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Do
not just look after you own selfish interests but each one of you should
consider the interests of others.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Let the following be in your mind, which was
also in [the mind of] Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>He who existed in the form<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1971" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1971"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1971]</span></span></span></a>
of God did not consider equality with God as something to be taken by force.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1972" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1972"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1972]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Instead, he emptied<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1973" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1973"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1973]</span></span></span></a>
himself, taking the form of a bondservant, being made in the likeness of men. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>And
being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to [the point
of] death, even death on the cross! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Therefore, God highly exalted
him, and gave him the Name which is above every name; <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>so that at
the Name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven, on earth, and under the
earth; <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Call to obedience</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>And so, my beloved, even as you have always
obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your
own salvation with fear and trembling, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>for it is God<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1974" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1974"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1974]</span></span></span></a>
who works in you, both to will and to work, according to his good purpose. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Do
all things without murmurings and disputes <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>in order to become
blameless and harmless, children of God without fault<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1975" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1975"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1975]</span></span></span></a>
in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you are seen as
lights in the world. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Uphold the word<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1976" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1976"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1976]</span></span></span></a>
of life, so that I may have a reason to glory<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1977" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1977"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1977]</span></span></span></a>
in the day of Christ: that I did not run or labor in vain. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Yes,
even if I am poured out [as an offering<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1978" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1978"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1978]</span></span></span></a>]
on the sacrifice and liturgy<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1979" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1979"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1979]</span></span></span></a>
of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>In the
same way, rejoice, rejoice with me!</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul and Timothy—About Epaphroditus</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>I hope in the Lord Jesus [that I will be able]
to send you Timothy soon, so that I too may be encouraged when I learn how you
are doing. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>For I have no one else with the same soul,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1980" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1980"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1980]</span></span></span></a>
who will truly care about you, <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>unlike others who seek their own,
not the things of Christ Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>But you know how he has proved
himself; as a child serves a father, he has served with me to spread the Good
News. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Therefore, I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how
things are going with me [here]. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>As it is, I trust in the Lord
that I too will be able to come shortly. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Still, I deemed it
necessary to send you Epaphroditus who is my brother, fellow worker, fellow
soldier, and your apostle and the servant of my need. <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>He was
longing for you all and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was
sick. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Indeed, he was sick, almost to the point of death! But God
had mercy on him; and not on him only, but also on me, so that I may not have
sorrow upon sorrow. <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>And so, I have sent him all the more eagerly,
so that you may rejoice when you see him again, and that I may be less
sorrowful. <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Receive him in the Lord with all joy, and hold such a
person in honor, <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>because on account of the work of Christ, he came
near to death, risking his life to provide what was lacking in your ministry to
me.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Warning against evil-workers—Paul’s background</p>

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-1-5" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord! To me, writing
the same things to you is not tiresome—it is safe! <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Beware of the
dogs, beware of evil-workers, beware of the false circumcision! <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>We
are ‘circumcised’ if we offer divine service<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1981" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1981"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1981]</span></span></span></a>
in the Spirit of God, [if we] rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
in the flesh, <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>although I myself could have confidence even in the
flesh! If anyone thinks that he has {a reason to have} confidence in the flesh,
I could even more: <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the
people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. As regards the
law, I was a Pharisee; <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>as far as zeal is concerned, I was
persecuting the Church, and as for the righteousness which is based on the law,
[I was] found blameless.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">All things considered as a loss—Reaching forward</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre91">7</span></sup><span class="calibre91">However, these things which I thought were gain to
me, I have counted as loss for Christ! <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Yes, without a doubt, I
consider all things as loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ
Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things. I consider them as
dung, so that I may gain Christ <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>and be found in him, not having a
righteousness of my own (from the law), but through faith in Christ (the
righteousness which is from God by faith). <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Yes, may I know him,
and the power of his resurrection, and the communion of his sufferings,
becoming conformed to his death, <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>if by any means I may attain to
the resurrection from the dead. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>I am not saying that I have
already obtained these things or that I am already made perfect; but I press on
to take hold<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1982" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1982"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre92">[1982]</span></span></span></a>
of [the prize] for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Brethren, I do yet not regard myself as already
having obtained these things, but I do this: forgetting the things which are
now behind and reaching forward to the things which are before [me], <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>I
press on toward the goal; and the prize is the high calling of God in Christ
Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Let us who are mature, therefore, think this way, and if
you think differently in some way, God will also reveal that to you. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Nevertheless,
to whatever [point] we have already reached, let us walk by the same &lt;rule
and let us be of the same mind.&gt;<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1983" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1983"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1983]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Brethren, be united in imitating me, and keep
your eyes fixed on those who live this way, even as you have us as an example. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>But
there are many who live as enemies of the cross of Christ, as I remind you
often, as I do [even] now with tears. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Their end is destruction,
their god is the belly, and their glory is in their shame as they think about
earthly things. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>As for us, our citizenship is in heaven, from
which we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>He will
change the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory,
according to the energy<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1984" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1984"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1984]</span></span></span></a>
by which he is able to subject all things to himself.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1985" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1985"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1985]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Instructions—The peace of God</p>

<p class="chapter-number chapter-number--nudge-2" id="toc_4">4</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I miss so much, my joy
and my crown, stand firm in the Lord! <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>I exhort Evodia and Syntyche
to think the same way in the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Yes, I beg you also, Syzygus,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1986" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1986"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1986]</span></span></span></a>
help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News and also with
Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
<sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, rejoice! <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Let
your kindness be known to all. The Lord is at hand! <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Do not be
anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition with
thanksgiving, let your requests be known to God. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>And the peace of
God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your
thoughts in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre27">8</span></sup><span class="calibre27">Finally, brethren, whatever things are true,
whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are
pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are commendable, if there is
any virtue or any praise, think about these things. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>What you
learned, received, heard, and saw in me—practice these things, and the God of
peace will be with you.</span></p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Paul’s needs and thankfulness</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But now, I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that
your consideration<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn1987" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1987"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1987]</span></span></span></a>
for me has blossomed again! (I know that you were thinking about me but lacked
the opportunity). <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>I do not want to speak about what I lack,
because I have learned to be satisfied with whatever state I am in! <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>I
know how to be humbled, and I also know how to overflow. In everything and in
all things I have learned the secret of being both filled and hungry, of being
in abundance and in need. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>I can do all these things through Christ
who strengthens me. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>However, it was a good thing that you shared
in my affliction. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>As you Philippians know as well, in the
beginning of the Good News when I departed from Macedonia, no Church shared
with me in the matter of giving and receiving—only you did! <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>For
even [when I was] in Thessalonica you supplied help for my needs once and
again. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>It is not that I seek the gift; what I value is the
interest that is accumulating in your account! <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>I actually have all
things and I overflow since I received from Epaphroditus what came from you, a
sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God! <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>My
God will supply all of your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ
Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>To our God and Father be the glory unto ages of ages! Amen.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus! The brethren
who are with me greet you. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>All the saints greet you, especially
those who are of Caesar’s household. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all! Amen.</p>
