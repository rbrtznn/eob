<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The article under consideration continues with a clear and
helpful discussion of the essential difference of approach between East and
West:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">A second distinction that needs to be drawn lies
between the views of the Eastern and Western theological traditions… What is
the major point of difference between the Eastern and Western Church? It has to
do with the understanding of the relationship of the Father to the Monarchy of
the Godhead. Both East and West are agreed that the Father has a certain
priority of position within the Trinity. The Father alone is unbegotten and
non-proceeding. But does the Monarchy, the font of Deity, reside in the Father’s
person, or in his Being? Is the Son begotten of the Father’s person, or his
Being? <span class="calibre34">Does the Spirit proceed from the Father’s person, or his Being</span>? <span class="calibre34">If,
as the Eastern Church insists, the font of Deity resides in the Father’s person,
then the Spirit clearly must proceed from the Father alone, since the Son does
not possess the Father’s person</span>. But if the font of Deity resides in the
Father’s Being, then the conclusion may be drawn that the Spirit proceeds from
the Father and the Son, since all are agreed that the Father and the Son are
con-substantial, that is, that they are identical in essence. Largely due to
the influence of Augustine, the Western Church gradually settled on the view
that the Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, and eventually the
words “and the Son” were added to the text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan
Creed.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The above summary deserves to be read with extreme care,
since the real debate over the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> is explained with great clarity.
This is exactly what St. Photius had explained in his <i class="calibre4">Mystagogy of the Holy
Spirit</i>:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">If the Father is cause of the hypostases
produced from Him not by reason of nature, but by reason of the hypostasis; and
if, up to now, no one has preached the impiety that the Son’s hypostasis
consists of the principle of the Father’s hypostasis… then there can be no way
the Son is cause of any hypostasis in the Trinity.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2829" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2829"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2829]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">At this point, Paul Owen continues his presentation with
great accuracy:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">This argument has important theological
ramifications. If the font of Deity is located in the Father’s person, then the
divine nature of the Son and the Spirit will of necessity be <span class="calibre34">a derived
divinity</span>. In fact, it is a general tendency of the Eastern Fathers (Gregory
Nazianzen excluded<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2830" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2830"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2830]</span></span></span></a>)
to speak of God the Father as the cause of the Deity of the Son and the Spirit.
The issue at stake is whether or not each of the Persons of the Trinity can be
spoken of properly as God in their own right (<i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>). Thomas F.
Torrance writes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent5">When the Cappadocian
theologians argued for the doctrine of one Being, three Persons (<i class="calibre4">mia ousia
treis hypostaseis</i>) they did so on the ground that the <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> had the
same relation to the <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> as the general or common to the
particular. They pointed, for instance, to the way three different people have
a common nature or <i class="calibre4">physis</i>. They absorbed the Nicene <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> of the
Father (<i class="calibre4">ousia tou Patros</i>) into the <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i> of the Father (<i class="calibre4">hypostasis
tou Patros</i>), and then when they spoke of the three divine Persons as having
the same being or nature, they were apt to identify <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> with <i class="calibre4">physis</i>
or nature. Thereby they tended to give <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> an abstract generic sense
which had the effect of making them treat <i class="calibre4">ousia</i> or <i class="calibre4">physis</i> as
impersonal. Then when in addition they concentrated Christian faith directly
upon the three distinct hypostases of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
as they are united through their common action, they were charged with thinking
of God in a partitive or tritheistic way, three Gods with a common nature,
which of course they rejected. They sought to meet this charge by establishing
their belief in the oneness of God through anchoring it in the Father as the
one Origin or Principle or Cause, <i class="calibre4">Arche</i> or <i class="calibre4">Aitia</i>, of divine
Unity, and they spoke of the Son and of the Holy Spirit as deriving their
distinct modes of subsistence or coming into existence (<i class="calibre4">tropoi hyparxeos</i>)
from the Father as the Fount of Deity (<i class="calibre4">pege <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="Return_42">theotetos</a></i>).
<span class="calibre34">But they went further and argued that the Son and the Spirit derive their
being (<i class="calibre4">einai</i>) and indeed their Deity (<i class="calibre4">theotes</i>) from the Father by
way of unique causation (<i class="calibre4">aitia</i>)</span> which comprises and is continuous
with its effects, and by that they meant the Father considered as <i class="calibre4">Person</i>,
i.e. as <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i>, not <i class="calibre4">ousia</i>, which represented a divergence
from the teaching of the Nicene Council.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2831" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2831"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2831]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Hence there is an element of ontological
subordinationism which remains in the Eastern view, which in the mind of those
inclined toward the view of the Western tradition leaves the door open to
implicit Arianism… The West insists that the three eternal Persons share a
common Deity—each Person is <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>. The East maintains that the three
eternal Persons share a common Divinity—the Father alone is Deity in a proper
sense (<i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Paul Owen is correct when he notes that the Western
tradition tends to the conclusion that each Person is <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>, but it
should be clear that this has never been the official teaching of Roman
Catholicism. This heresy of tri-theism was only proclaimed by John Calvin who
denounced the eternal generation of the Son as “an absurd fiction.” However, we
are getting close to what is at stake with the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>: is the Monarchy
of the Father as only cause and origin of the Son and Spirit challenged by this
clause? Roman Catholic theologians have tried to reassure the Orthodox East
that this is not the case. In its clarification on the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>, the
Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity affirms:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Greek Fathers and the whole Christian Orient
speak, in this regard, of the “Father’s Monarchy,” and the Western tradition,
following St Augustine, also confesses that the Holy Spirit takes his origin
from the Father “principaliter,” that is, as principle (De Trinitate XV, 25,
47, PL 42, 1094-1095). In this sense, therefore, the two traditions recognize
that the “Monarchy of the Father” implies that the Father is the sole
Trinitarian Cause (<span>α</span><span>ἰ</span><span>τία</span>) or Principle (principium)
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Likewise, in his article <i class="calibre4">Filioque</i><i class="calibre4">: A Response To Eastern Orthodox Objections,</i> Roman Catholic author Marc Bonocore repeats several times that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Both Greek East and Latin West confess, and
always have confessed, that the Father alone is the Cause (Aition) or Principle
(Principium) of both the Son and the Spirit.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In a remarkable essay entitled <i class="calibre4">The Filioque</i><i class="calibre4">: Dogma, Theologoumenon or Error?</i>, Fr. Theodore Stylianopoulous (Greek Orthodox)
stresses the importance of this point:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Similarly Moltmann observes that “the filioque
was never directed against the ‘monarchy’ of the Father” and that the principle
of the “monarchy” has “never been contested by the theologians of the Western
Church.” If these statements can be accepted by the Western theologians today
in their full import of doing justice to the principle of the Father’s
“monarchy,” which is so important to Eastern triadology, then the theological
fears of Easterners about the filioque would seem to be fully relieved.
Consequently, Eastern theologians could accept virtually any of the
Memorandum’s alternate formulae in the place of the filioque on the basis of
the above positive evaluation of the filioque which is in harmony with Maximos
the Confessor’s interpretation of it. As Zizioulas incisively concludes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The “golden rule” must be Saint Maximos the
Confessor’s explanation concerning Western pneumatology: by professing the
filioque our Western brethren do not wish to introduce another <span>α</span><span>ἴ</span><span>τον</span> in God’s being except the
Father, and a mediating role of the Son in the origination of the Spirit is not
to be limited to the divine Economy, but relates also to the divine <span>ο</span><span>ὐ</span><span>σία</span>.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">It is important to understand that the Eastern Orthodox
doctrine of icons is rooted in its Trinitarian theology: the ‘relative worship’
(or veneration) (<i class="calibre4">proskynesis</i>) of icons (derived images of God) is proper
if the ultimate object of worship (<i class="calibre4">latreia</i>) is the uncreated Trinity and
even more ultimately the uncaused and unoriginate Father of whom Christ is the
perfect “icon,” the “<i class="calibre4">character</i> of his <i class="calibre4">hypostasis</i>.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2832" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2832"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2832]</span></span></span></a>
Legitimate honor and veneration due to a created image of God (parents, kings,
saints) becomes idolatry if it is by intention disconnected from the ultimate
prototype which is for us the Trinity and in an ultimate ontological sense, the
person of the Father.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Unlike Paul Owen (and Photius), not everyone is fully aware
that the critical question is “Does the Spirit proceed from the Father’s person,
or his Being? If, as [Eastern Orthodoxy] insists, the font of Deity resides in
the Father’s person, then the Spirit clearly must proceed from the Father
alone, since the Son does not possess the Father’s person.” In <i class="calibre4">Being as
Communion</i>, Metropolitan John Zizioulas offer a masterful defense of the
Orthodox insistence of the priority of the person of the Father:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Among the Greek Fathers the unity of God, the
one God, and the ontological principle or “cause” of the being and life of God
does not consist in the one substance of God but in the hypostasis, that is,
the person of the Father. The one God is not the one substance but the Father,
who is the “cause” both of the generation of the Son and of the procession of
the Spirit. Consequently, the ontological “principle” of God is traced back,
once again, to the person. Thus when we say that God “is,” we do not bind the
personal freedom of God—the being of God is not an ontological “necessity” or a
simple “reality” for God—but we ascribe the being of God to His personal
freedom. In a more analytical way this means that God, as Father and not as
substance, perpetually confirms through “being” His free will to exist. And it
is precisely His trinitarian existence that constitutes this confirmation: the
Father out of love—that is, freely—begets the Son and brings forth the Spirit.
If God exists, He exists because the Father exists, that is, He who out of love
freely begets the Son and brings forth the Spirit. Thus God as person—as the
hypostasis of the Father—makes the one divine substance to be that which it is:
the one God. This point is absolutely crucial. For it is precisely with this
point that the new philosophical position of the Cappadocian Fathers, and of St
Basil in particular, is directly connected. That is to say, the substance never
exists in a “naked” state, that is, without hypostasis, without “a mode of
existence.” And the one divine substance is consequently the being of God only
because it has these three modes of existence, which it owes not to the
substance but to one person, the Father. Outside the Trinity there is no God,
that is, no divine substance, because the ontological “principle” of God is the
Father. The personal existence of God (the Father) constitutes His substance,
makes it hypostases. The being of God is identified with the person. What
therefore is important in trinitarian theology is that God “exists” on account
of a person, the Father, and not on account of a substance<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2833" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2833"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2833]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Orthodox theology is especially clear on this
emphasis on “the <span lang="EN">simplicity of the Most High” (Photius</span><span lang="EN">) because it has no fear of the absurd accusation of Arianism</span><span lang="EN">.</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Before discussing the intent and historical context of the Latin
<i class="calibre4">filioque</i>, let us conclude our brief review of important Trinitarian
concepts. Returning to Paul Owen’s article, we encounter another useful
clarification:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In contemporary theological and philosophical
discussion, there are two heuristic approaches to understanding the Trinity.
There is a “social” model, and there is a “psychological” or “modal” (not “modalistic”)
model. Generally speaking, these two approaches can be traced back to the
differences between the East and the West in their articulation of the nature
of the “oneness” of the Godhead; but the current “social” model is also largely
driven by perceived philosophical difficulties with the doctrine of the Trinity
as articulated in Western manifestos such as the so-called Athanasian Creed.
The “modal” or “psychological” model goes back to Augustine, and has been advocated by important thinkers in our century such as Karl Barth,
Karl Rahner, Donald Bloesch, Kelly James Clark and Thomas F. Torrance. The “social”
model is more heavily indebted to the Cappadocians, and is represented by
theologians such as Cornelius Plantinga, Leonardo Boff, Jürgen Moltmann,
Richard Swinburne, Millard Erickson and Clark Pinnock…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In [the psychological model], the distinctness
in union of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is thought of as being something
like (“analogous to”) the distinctness, say, of a person’s intellect, heart,
and will within the unity of the one person (St. Augustine).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">It is in the context of admittedly speculative reflection on
the mystery of the Trinity that St. Augustine, while affirming the Monarchy of
the Father, described the Holy Spirit as “the bond of love” between the Father
and the Son. This is why Augustine taught that the Spirit proceeds “mainly” (<i class="calibre4">principaliter</i>
means an original source and implies a secondary source) from the Father, but
also from the Son, not only economically but indeed ontologically. The
following illustration is a generally accepted way to express the
Western-Augustinian emphasis:</p>

<p class="body-text align-center mt-6"><span><img border="0" id="Picture 16" src="../images/00001.jpeg" alt="TrinityW" class="calibre140"/></span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Let us note, however, that the psychological imagery was
also used by the second-century apologists, notably Athenagoras of Athens:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The understanding and reason (<i class="calibre4">nous kai logos</i>)
of the Father is the Son of God. But if, in your surpassing intelligence, it
occurs to you to inquire what is meant by the Son, I will state briefly that He
is the first product of the Father, not as having been brought into existence
(for from the beginning, God, who is the eternal mind [<i class="calibre4">nous</i>], had the
Logos in Himself, being from eternity instinct with Logos [<i class="calibre4">logikos</i>]; but
inasmuch as He came forth to be the idea and energizing power of all material
things…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2834" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2834"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2834]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Nevertheless, the overall Eastern tradition, because it
stresses the Scriptural and pre-Nicene teaching of the Monarchy of the Father,
prefers St. Ireneaus’ pyramid vision of the Word and Spirit as “the two hands
of God:”</p>

<p class="body-text align-center mt-6"><span><img border="0" id="Picture 17" src="../images/00001.jpeg" alt="TrinityE" class="calibre141"/></span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Based on what has been said so far, it might be tempting to
think that both models are absolutely incompatible. However, many Orthodox
theologians do not think that it is the case. The reason for this more
optimistic assessment is fivefold: (1) the Roman Catholic tradition has always
affirmed (when pressed) that the Father is indeed “the principle without
principle” of the Trinity; (2) the intention of the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> is
different than that of the Creed of 381; (3) the fact that in a specific sense,
the expression<i class="calibre4"> qui ex Patre Filioque</i><i class="calibre4"> procedit </i>is orthodox
(Romanides); (4) Rome has “refused the addition<i class="calibre4"> kai to yiou </i>to the
formula <i class="calibre4">ek tou patros ekporevomenon</i> in the Greek text” (quoting the
Vatican’s Clarification) and (5) the expression “through the Son” (or
variations thereof), especially with the verb <i class="calibre4">proinai</i> is patristic and
acceptable.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">On the other hand, there are boundaries to trinitarian
Orthodoxy as well as concerning difficulties with the Roman Catholic approach.</p>
