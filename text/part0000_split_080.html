<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418729"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418581"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267640">Defining the word</a></h3>

<p class="msonormal1">What do we mean when we say ‘Church?’ We often hear or use
such expressions as: “There is no salvation outside the Church,” “The Church of
Russia,” “The Greek Orthodox Church,” “The Roman Catholic Church,” “The Church is the Body of Christ,” or “Christians should go to Church.”
All contain the term ‘Church,’ but obviously in a very inconsistent way.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">It is agreed that properly speaking, the word ‘Church’
refers to people, not to a building. Secondly, it is reasonable to argue that
the meaning of the word ‘Church’ should be defined by the Scriptures and its
apostolic interpretation found in the writings of the Early Fathers, not by
modern usage.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">By searching the New Testament for every occurrence of the
word ‘Church’ (or ‘Churches’), one can obtain a clear picture of what it is
that God established “by the price of the blood of his own [Son].”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2705" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2705"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2705]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">On the one hand, the Church is an eschatological reality
that transcends space and time. It could be said that God knows, foreknows and
has a relationship with us that is not constrained by the here and now (1 Cor.
13:12). He knows his elect from “before the foundation of the world.” The early
Christian (and orthodox) doctrine of the so-called ‘pre-existence’ of the
Church is well established.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2706" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2706"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2706]</span></span></span></a>
For instance, the <i class="calibre4">Shepherd of Hermas</i> teaches that “She [the Church] was
the first of all creation… and the world was made for her”.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2707" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2707"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2707]</span></span></span></a>
The early homily known as 2 Clement is even more explicit:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Moreover, the books and the Apostles declare that the Church belongs not to the present, but existed from the origin [beginning,
source].<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2708" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2708"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2708]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">In order to understand reality properly, that is according
to the mind of the Spirit, we must discern within time and creation a dynamic
movement towards its <i class="calibre4">telos</i> or end.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2709" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2709"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2709]</span></span></span></a>
On the one hand, our human consciousness experiences the universe as
‘purpose-driven.’ But could it be that our experience of the arrow of time is
only an icon or foretaste of the reality that already exists in God? A
beautiful exposition of this profound truth is found in the writings of St.
Maximus the Confessor who summarized it in these words: “The things of the past
are shadow; those of the present icon; the truth is to be found in the things
of the future.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2710" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2710"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2710]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">In his classic <i class="calibre4">Being as Communion</i>, Metropolitan John
(Zizioulas) of Pergamon makes the point that the Eucharistic liturgy is also “a
remembrance of the future,” because the Church below<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2711" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2711"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2711]</span></span></span></a>
is a manifestation of the Church beyond.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2712" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2712"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2712]</span></span></span></a>
The great Orthodox theologian compares us with trees “with branches in the
present and roots in the future.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2713" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2713"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2713]</span></span></span></a>
This is why the great prayer of consecration of the liturgy of St. John
Chrysostom can say:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent"><span class="calibre34">Remembering</span>, therefore, this command of
the Savior, and <span class="calibre34">all that has come to pass</span> for our sake, the cross, the
tomb, the resurrection on the third day, the ascension into heaven, the sitting
at the right hand of the Father, <span class="calibre34">and the second and glorious coming</span>…</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the Church, we are already “new creatures in Christ,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2714" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2714"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2714]</span></span></span></a>
and even in our present <i class="calibre4">chronos </i>(time), we are revealed as foreknown,
predestined, called, justified and glorified. The apparent contradiction
between ‘pastoral free will’ passages and those stressing eternal divine
election<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2715" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2715"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2715]</span></span></span></a>
simply reflect the tension between two perspectives on reality.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Clement of Alexandria aptly summarized the relationship
between the Church of the elect above and the Church below in these words:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The earthly Church is the image of the heavenly.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2716" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2716"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2716]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Scholarly research in the origins and meaning of early
Christian worship, which was itself based on Temple worship, confirms this
approach. In a paragraph fittingly entitled <i class="calibre4">Time and Eternity</i>, one such
scholar documents how “beyond the veil” of the Holy of Holies, the whole
history of the world appeared in one glimpse, as a literally ‘omni-present’<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2717" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2717"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2717]</span></span></span></a>
picture:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In the world view of the temple, there was
another, timeless state beyond the veil which was not ‘future’ but always
present.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2718" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2718"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2718]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the perspective of our experience of time, of our <i class="calibre4">eon</i>
or ‘age,’ the Church is “the body of Christ,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2719" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2719"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2719]</span></span></span></a>
the means by which temporal creatures can be united to the eternal God-Man and
become “partakers of the divine nature”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2720" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2720"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2720]</span></span></span></a>
now and in “the age to come.” The purpose of the Church is that the <i class="calibre4">many</i>
creatures would be <i class="calibre4">one</i> with God the Father in Jesus Christ, so that “God
may be all in all.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2721" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2721"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2721]</span></span></span></a>
The Church is the means by which human beings can enter in this new mode of
existence not “born of the flesh” but “of the Spirit.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2722" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2722"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2722]</span></span></span></a>
To describe this reality, the expressions “eschatological,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2723" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2723"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2723]</span></span></span></a>
pre-eternal, fulfilled or supra-temporal Church” are all fitting.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This definition can sound identical with that of ‘Universal
Church.’ For instance, the <i class="calibre4">Catechism of the Orthodox Church</i> contains
this question and answer:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Q. Why is the Church called <i class="calibre4">Catholic</i>, or <i class="calibre4">Universal</i>, which is what catholic means?</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">A. Because she is not limited to any place,
time, or people, but contains true believers of all places, times, and peoples.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In this sense, both concepts are identical, even though the
early Church use of ‘catholic Church’ was usually reserved for the
manifestation of the pre-eternal Church in space and time. The problem is that
‘Universal/Catholic Church’ is mainly used to refer to all believers <span class="calibre34">now</span>
alive on earth. This is especially common in Roman Catholic terminology (and
theology), both for ‘Catholic Church’ and ‘Universal Church’.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, the mystery of the Church is the mystery of Christ
himself and the Eucharistic gathering is what constitutes and manifests the
Church in space and time, ‘this side of the curtain.’ In the Eucharist, we
experience an intersection of the eternal “lamb slaughtered from the foundation
of the world”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2724" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2724"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2724]</span></span></span></a>
with our ‘here and now.’ The very institution of the Eucharist makes the
connection, indeed the identity of Eucharist-Church obvious: “this is my body”
refers to both interchangeably. In 1 Corinthians 11, a chapter entirely
dedicated to the Eucharistic life of “the Church of God that is at Corinth,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2725" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2725"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2725]</span></span></span></a>
we find this significant expression: “<span class="calibre34">when you come together as [a] Church</span>.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2726" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2726"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2726]</span></span></span></a>
In other words, it is the gathering of the people of God to celebrate the
Lord’s Supper that makes the Church be—in the sense of a manifestation of the
eschatological Church and Lamb. It is the same Holy Spirit who is called upon
to manifest the Christ, both in the waters of Jordan and in the Eucharistic
assembly.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the liturgy of St. Basil, we pray:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">That thy Holy Spirit may come <span class="calibre34">upon us</span> and
upon <span class="calibre34">these gifts</span> here set forth, and bless them and hallow them and <span class="calibre34">show</span>
this bread to be itself the precious Body of Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ,
and this cup to be itself the precious Blood of Lord, God and Savior Jesus
Christ…</p>

We now understand why St. Paul uses the expression “the whole Church”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2727" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2727"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2727]</span></span></span></a>
(<span>o[lhj th/j evkklhsi,aj</span>) to
refer to the local Church. The local Church is the whole Church, and Paul
always uses the singular (“to the Church of God that is in Corinth”) when he
mentions the local Church. By contrast, Churches (plural) refers to regional or
organizational groups. In other words, 1 “whole Church” + 1 “whole Church” + 1
“whole Church” = the “whole Church” in 3 places or 3 “Churches.” Paul does not
say “the Church in Galatia” or “the Church of Achaia (Greece)” because it is
improper terminology!<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2728" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2728"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2728]</span></span></span></a>
There is not a single Eucharist in Galatia or in Achaia and therefore we cannot
consider all the Christians in those areas ‘in bulk’ and call them ‘a Church.’
“Exiles” and “saints” in Asia or Galatia<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2729" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2729"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2729]</span></span></span></a>
certainly, but not as Church. The same can be said of our modern use of ‘Church’
(as in ‘Orthodox Church’) to refer to a worldwide communion of local catholic
Churches, what we often call ‘the universal Church.’ As in the case of regional
Churches, there is no ‘universal (worldwide) Eucharist.’ Because of this, using
the word ‘Church’ in the expression ‘universal Church’ (or to say ‘the church
needs a new roof’) is certainly convenient and commonplace, but it is also
improper and potentially misleading.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">To summarize, the Church, strictly speaking, is the Body of
Christ, the eschatological unity of all those who have been united to Christ’s
life in all times and places. This is the foundational use of ‘Church’ in the
New Testament. The other proper use for ‘Church,’ in a way that connects with
our realm, is in reference to the gathering of Christians from a specific area
to celebrate the Eucharist. If in Matthew 16:18, the meaning of Church is
uncertain, Matthew 18 undoubtedly uses the same word to describe the local
community. This “whole Church” is the manifestation of the eschatological
Church in our world, in our town. Beyond that, we have “Churches.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre27">There is a great risk of
equating (and confusing) the eschatological Church with the sum of all the
local Churches in existence on earth at one particular point in time, i.e. the
so-called ‘universal Church.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2730" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2730"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[2730]</span></span></span></a>
The idea that all Christians alive on earth form a universal organism or
society called Church is a central element of Roman Catholic</span><span class="calibre27"> ecclesiology. According to this view, the Church—the
“whole Church”—is first and foremost “the faithful everywhere.” Hence, the
unity of the Church depends on all the local Churches being joined to their
ontological head (in this case the Roman Church), to form a single worldwide
body called “the Catholic Church</span><span class="calibre27">.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2731" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2731"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[2731]</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, before discussing the ecclesiological paradigm more
at length, let us first try to understand what the word ‘catholic’ originally meant.</p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418730"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418582"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267641">The catholic</a> Church as a hologram</h3>

<p class="msonormal1">When we confess our faith in the “Church,” or the “one,
holy, catholic and apostolic Church,” we are confessing the existence of the
Church, both ‘pre-eternal’ and ‘manifested’ in our world, as something
essential for our salvation. But what does “catholic” mean? Does it mean
universal or whole or both? And how do we recognize and identify this catholic
Church confessed in our creed?</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Eucharistic theology is the view that <i class="calibre4">the catholic</i><i class="calibre4"> Church</i><i class="calibre4"> is fundamentally the local Eucharistic assembly, gathered around
its bishop</i>. Thus, the ‘Church of God which is at Ephesus or Corinth’ is the “whole Church” and the “catholic Church.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In terms of etymology, ‘catholic’ comes from <i class="calibre4">kat’holon</i>,
a cognate of <i class="calibre4">holis</i>. In other words, catholic means ‘according to
wholeness.’ Catholic is also connected with ‘holographic’ inasmuch as the word
‘hologram’ is based on the same root as ‘catholic.’ A hologram can be described
as follows:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">A hologram is a three-dimensional photograph
made with the aid of a laser… When the film is developed, it looks like a
meaningless swirl of light and dark lines. But as soon as the developed film is
illuminated by another laser beam, a three-dimensional image of the original
object appears. The three-dimensionality of such images is not the only
remarkable characteristic of holograms. If a hologram of a rose is cut in half
and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the
entire image of the rose. Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, each
snippet of film will always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of
the original image. Unlike normal photographs, every part of a hologram
contains all the information possessed by the whole. </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The “whole in every part” nature of a hologram
provides us with an entirely new way of understanding organization and order.
For most of its history, Western science has labored under the bias that the
best way to understand a physical phenomenon, whether a frog or an atom, is to
dissect it and study its respective parts. </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">A hologram teaches us that some things in the
universe may not lend themselves to this approach. If we try to take apart
something constructed holographically, we will not get the partial pieces from
which it is made, we will only get smaller wholes.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2732" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2732"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2732]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Indeed, the relationship between Church and Eucharist is
significant as we recall the words of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Broken and distributed is the Lamb of God;
broken, but not divided; forever eaten yet never consumed; sanctifying all who
partake.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2733" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2733"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2733]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The similarity with holographic objects is striking. By
contrast, the paradigm of Western science is also that of Western theology, and
we can paraphrase Michael Talbot as follows:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Western theology has labored under the bias that
the best way to understand a physical phenomenon, whether a frog or an atom (or
the Church), is to dissect it and study its respective parts.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In other words, conventional Western ecclesiology used to
tell us that there is one big worldwide universal Catholic Church, of which local Churches are only parts. According to this view, the parts
are not “whole” individually, one has to take all the parts to have the whole.
Reflecting this approach, the <i class="calibre4">Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> uses
traditional Western terminology:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[The bishops should] rule well their own
Churches <span class="calibre34">as portions</span> of the universal Church.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2734" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2734"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2734]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Likewise, in an unpublished article entitled <i class="calibre4">What Does
Catholic Mean? A History of the Word “Catholic,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2735" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2735"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2735]</span></b></span></span></a></i>
Roman Catholic apologist Steve Ray explains:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">However, we have yet to define the word
catholic. It comes from the Greek <i class="calibre4">katholikos</i>, the combination of two
words: <i class="calibre4">kata</i>- concerning, and <i class="calibre4">holos</i>- whole. According to the
Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, the word catholic comes from a Greek
word meaning “regarding the whole,” or more simply, “universal” or “general.”
Universal comes from two Greek words: <i class="calibre4">uni—</i>one, and <i class="calibre4">vertere—</i>turning.
In other words, a “one turning,” “revolving around one,” or “turned into one.”
The word Church comes from the Greek ecclesia which means “those called out,”
as in those summoned out of the world at large to form a distinct society.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Orthodox can only agree with this presentation, although
care is required to properly understand what is meant by “those summoned out of
the world at large to form a distinct society.” From an Orthodox perspective,
the problem arises when Steve Ray concludes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">So the Catholic Church is made up of those called out and gathered into the universal visible society founded by Christ.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">But universal is an imprecise word. It can mean “not limited
to any place, nor time, nor people, but contains true believers of all places,
times, and peoples,” which can be called eschatological or pre-eternal.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2736" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2736"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2736]</span></span></span></a>
But this does not seem to be the intended meaning. Instead, “universal visible
society founded by Christ” conveys the idea of ‘<span class="calibre34">worldwide</span> visible
society founded by Christ.’</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre27">Hence, if the Church is
disconnected from its Eucharistic nature, the temptation is great to define
‘Catholic Church’</span><span class="calibre27"> in a space-universal<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2737" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2737"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre30">[2737]</span></span></span></a> sense. However, there is
no single universal Eucharist and no single universal bishop, and hence no
universal (worldwide) Church. From an Orthodox perspective, a more accurate
conclusion to the above quoted article would be:</span></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">So the catholic Church is made up of those called out and gathered (to manifest the Church) through a visible, local
community that participates in and offers the Eucharist under the presidency of
its bishop.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">‘Space-universal catholic ecclesiology’ is based on imprecise terminology and can easily be misleading. More importantly,
it does not offer a faithful witness to the ecclesiology of the New Testament
or of the early Church.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">If we used the illustration of holographic objects, the
catholic Church (the local Eucharistic assembly) is a complete whole which
stands on its own. It contains the basic ‘pattern’ or ‘code’ and it is capable
of manifesting the “whole picture.” Moreover, if we look at several Churches,
we do not have parts or portions coming together like a jigsaw puzzle or a
mosaic. We have whole units revealing the eschatological picture with increased
accuracy, and the original that is being revealed is the heavenly Church, not
the so-called ‘universal  (worldwide) Church.’</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As a result, the catholic Church is meant to be “one” by its very own nature.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2738" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2738"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2738]</span></span></span></a>
If the pattern is there, we have “the whole Church;” if not, there is either
nothing or a different picture.

<p class="msonormal1">In his important essay on ecclesiology entitled <i class="calibre4">Called to Communion: Understanding the Church today</i>, Cardinal
Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) offers a clear exposition of the Roman Catholic understanding of ‘Church’ and ‘catholic Church:’</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Church embraces the many languages, that is,
the many cultures, that in faith understand and fecundate one another. In this
respect it can be said that we find here a preliminary sketch of a Church that
lives in manifold and multiform particular Churches but that precisely in this
way is one Church. At the same time, Luke expresses with this image the fact
that at the moment of her birth, the Church was already catholic, already <span class="calibre34">a world Church</span>. Luke thus rules out a conception in which a local
Church first arose in Jerusalem and then became the base for the gradual
establishment of other Churches that eventually grew into a federation. Luke
tells us that the reverse is true: what first exists is the one Church, the
Church that speaks in all tongues—the <i class="calibre4">ecclesia universalis</i>; she then
generates Church in the most diverse locales, which nonetheless are all always
embodiments of the one and only Church. The <span class="calibre34">temporal and ontological
priority lies with the universal Church</span>; a Church that was not catholic
would not even have ecclesial reality.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2739" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2739"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2739]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">This short paragraph presents the emphasis of Roman Catholic ecclesiology. Yet, the problem is the potential lack of clarity of the words we
use: <i class="calibre4">ecclesia universalis</i> seems to be both a “world Church” and,
perhaps, the eschatological Church, in which case the Orthodox would
wholeheartedly agree. However, where the Orthodox would say that every (local)
Church has a universal, missionary vocation, Roman Catholics tend to see
universality or internationalism as an ontological fact from the start. The
result of this second view is that the Church (Catholic or universal) is first and foremost a “world Church,” not the local Church. In other words, the
reality of the Church is the big picture, the worldwide organism which is being
made manifest as more local Churches are created. Indeed, <i class="calibre4">Called to
Communion</i> rejects the Orthodox idea that the universal mission of the local
Church generates a federation of Churches that should not be called ‘Church’ in
the proper sense.</p>
