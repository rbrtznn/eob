<p class="msonormal1">The EOB New Testament was prepared for personal study and
liturgical use in English-speaking Orthodox Christian communities. Its format
and font are designed to make both activities accessible and rewarding. Every
attempt has been made to offer an accurate and scholarly translation of the
Greek text, free of the theological bias that has affected most other
translations of the New Testament, including the NIV (2 Thess. 2:15) and NAB
(Matt. 5:32).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Another intention of this translation is to foster interest
in learning the Greek language (biblical, patristic and modern), which is why
many footnotes make reference to the underlying Greek vocabulary.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The purpose of this edition is also to make the reader aware
of possible textual variants by footnoting all significant instances where the
Patriarchal Text (PT) may not agree with the Textus Receptus (TR), the Majority
Text (MT) or the Critical Text (CT). In several instances, the footnotes will
provide references to specific manuscripts.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Until the publication of the EOB, the King James and New
King James versions have been the preferred translations, partly because they
are based on the <b class="calibre7">Textus Receptus</b> (TR) which is a Byzantine-type text
that is close to the normative ecclesiastical text of the Greek-speaking
Orthodox Churches.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<div class="calibre26">

<p class="boxparcxspfirst"><span class="calibre27">The <b class="calibre7">Textus Receptus</b> (Latin: “received
text”) is the name subsequently given to the succession of printed Greek texts
of the New Testament which constituted the translation base for Luther’s
original German Bible. The TR was also used for the translation of the New Testament
into English by William Tyndale, for the King James Version, and for most other
Reformation-era New Testament translations throughout Western and Central
Europe.</span></p>

<p class="boxparcxspmiddle">This
series of printed texts originated with the first printed Greek New Testament
to be published. This project was undertaken in Basel in 1516 by Desiderius
Erasmus, a Dutch Roman Catholic scholar and humanist. This first TR was
assembled on the basis of six manuscripts which put together did not actually
contain the entirety of the New Testament. For this reason, the Erasmus TR is
especially problematic for the book of Revelation. Although based mainly on
late manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type, Erasmus’ edition differed markedly
from the classic form of that text. In 1,838 places (1,005 translatable) Textus
Receptus differs from the Byzantine text-type (Majority Text).</p>

<p class="boxparcxspmiddle"><br class="calibre6"/>
The TR was subsequently revised by Robert Estienne (known as Stefanus)
(1503-1559), a printer from Paris, who edited the Greek New Testament four
times: in 1546, 1549, 1550, and 1551.</p>

<p class="boxparcxsplast"><br class="calibre6"/>
The origin of the term “Textus Receptus” comes from the publisher’s preface to
the 1633 edition produced by the Elzevir brothers in Amsterdam.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Several versions of the <b class="calibre7">King James Version</b> (KJV) currently
exist, but all suffer from the imperfections of the Textus Receptus prepared by
Erasmus (1522, third edition) from a small number of manuscripts and revised by
Stephanus (1550). Moreover, the Old Testament of the KJV is mostly based on the
<b class="calibre7">Masoretic text</b> and fails to include significant Septuagintal variants.
Also, even though the original 1611 edition of the KJV included the so-called
‘apocryphal’ books, these were removed in subsequent editions, thus preventing
proper ecclesiastical use in an Orthodox context.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In North America, most parishes of the Orthodox Church in
America and of the Antiochian Archdiocese still use Elizabethan English in the
liturgy, in which case the KJV does provide linguistic continuity, although at
the expense of universal accessibility. In practice however, it seems that the
majority of Orthodox parishes read the Scriptures in formal but contemporary
English, often from the <b class="calibre7">New King James Version</b> (NKJV). This particular
modern-language translation is also based on the Textus Receptus and follows
the formal-equivalency approach and general style of the KJV. In addition, the
NKJV provides comprehensive footnotes which discuss significant variant
readings. One major limitation with the NKJV is that it is a commercial,
copyrighted translation which lies completely outside the control of the
Orthodox Christian community. Moreover, certain issues of translation and
terminology (discussed below) also called for revisions within an Orthodox
context.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The <b class="calibre7">EOB (Eastern/Greek Orthodox Bible or Holy Bible of
the [Eastern/Greek] Orthodox Churches) </b>addresses these limitations, both in
the Old and New Testaments. A limited copyright (see inner front page) is held
by the publisher but the text is non-commercial, held within the Orthodox
community and managed as a collaborative project, both for revisions and for
liturgical use. Moreover, Orthodox Christians are invited to submit their
suggestions so that the published text may be regularly updated and improved.</p>
