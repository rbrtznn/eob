<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Authorship/Date</b></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Matthew may be a translation or edition of a Hebrew or
Aramaic original. This proto-Matthew may have been written by the apostle
during and immediately after the ministry of Christ, especially if Matthew-Levi
functioned as the ‘scribe’ of the apostolic band. Hence, there may have been an
early recording of the Lord’s sayings which became a foundation for the Gospel
as we have it now in a Greek edition. Papias of Hierapolis (circa 100-120) is a
very early witness to this tradition:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Matthew composed the Logia (or “oracles/sayings
(of the Lord)” in the Hebrew tongue and everyone interpreted<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn25" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref25"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[25]</span></span></span></a>
them as he was able. (Papias quoted in Eusebius—<i class="calibre4">Ecclesiastical History</i>, 3.39.16)</p>

<p class="msonormal1"> Both Irenaeus of Lyons and Origen concurred with Papias:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the
Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and
laying the foundations of the Church. (Irenaeus quoted by Eusebius—<i class="calibre4">Ecclesiastical
History</i>, 3.39.16 and 5.25 for Origen’s confirmation)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Although modern scholarship sees Mark as the earliest Gospel
and as a major source used by the other evangelists, it is Matthew (or perhaps
an earlier form of Matthew) which was considered as the earliest Gospel by the
early Fathers. Significantly, the existence of a Hebrew (or Aramaic) Matthew is
attested by Eusebius.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[Pantaenus] was sent to preach the Gospel of
Christ to people in the East and went as far as India (possibly a reference to
Arabia or Ethiopia). He found that the Gospel of Matthew had preceded him there
among some who had come to know Christ. Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had
preached to them and had left them Matthew’s account in Hebrew letters which
was preserved until that time. (Eusebius—<i class="calibre4">Ecclesiastical History</i>, 5.10)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">St. Jerome also states that the Gospel of Matthew was
originally written in Hebrew: </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Matthew, also called Levi, an apostle and
previously a publican composed a Gospel of Christ. It was at first published in
Judea in Hebrew for the sake of those of the circumcision who believed, but
this was afterwards translated into Greek though by what author is uncertain.
The Hebrew itself has been preserved until the present day in the library at
Caesarea which Pamphilus so diligently gathered. I have also had the
opportunity of having the volume described to me by the Nazarenes of Beroea, a
city of Syria, who use it. In this, it is to be noted that wherever the
Evangelist, whether on his own account or in the person of our Lord the Savior
quotes the testimony of the Old Testament he does not follow the authority of the
translators of the Septuagint but the Hebrew. This is why these two forms exist
‘Out of Egypt have I called my son,’ and ‘for he shall be called a Nazarene… Pantaenus
was sent to India<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn26" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref26"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[26]</span></span></span></a>
by Demetrius bishop of Alexandria, where he found that Bartholomew, one of the
twelve apostles, had preached the advent of the Lord Jesus according to the Gospel
of Matthew. On his return to Alexandria, he brought this [document] with him
written in Hebrew characters (Jerome—<i class="calibre4">Lives of Illustrious Men</i>, ch. 3 and
36).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, only the Greek Matthew has survived and it is our
only canonical text. It seems to have originated in Antioch in the second half
of the first century.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><b class="calibre7">Theme(s)</b></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Gospel of Matthew is clearly addressed to a Jewish
readership. Its theological purpose is to present Jesus as ‘the Christ’ or
‘Messiah’ (‘anointed’) who is the new Moses and the fulfillment of the Old
Testament prophecies and typologies. Among the central themes developed in
Matthew’s Gospel are the issue of observance of the Law and commandments, the
Sabbath, the universal Messianic Kingdom and the Church.</p>
