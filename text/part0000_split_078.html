<p class="msonormal1">St. Clement of Rome’s Epistle to the Corinthians, written
before the end of the first century, should also be mentioned. Clement
indirectly recognized the traditional three-fold ministry of
“bishop/presbyter/deacon” (as reflected in Ignatius’ contemporary ecclesiology)
by drawing a parallel between first-century Christian ministry and the
three-fold ministry of “high priest/priest/Levite” in the Jewish Temple. Here,
we must keep in mind that 1 Clement was written to correct a schism in the
Corinthian Church, in which the legitimate presbyters had been overthrown and
cast out of the Church. Clement writes to tell the Corinthians that such
behavior is unacceptable, and that the Corinthian laity had no authority to
overthrow its legitimate presbyters.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">While Clement is speaking of the literal high priest, the
literal priests, and the literal Levites of the Jewish temple in the passage in
question, he refers to this three-fold Jewish ministry as a parallel example
when arguing for the legitimacy and divinely-created character of the Christian
ministerial offices. There would be no reason to cite the three-fold Jewish
ministry unless it held some significance for his audience.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">If we approach 1 Clement from the Western terminological
perspective, we have seen that the ancient author only recognized two (nominal)
Church ministries, “presbyter/bishop” and “deacon.” This is because he was
still utilizing the New Testament-period terminology, in which “presbyter” and
“bishop” were interchangeable terms. However, from a practical, ministerial,
and Eucharistic perspective, the author of 1 Clement would also have
distinguished between the man serving as Corinth’s leading presbyter (e.g. the
“high priest,” permanent president of the Eucharistic liturgy) and the other
presbyters among him (e.g. “the priests”), because this individual leading
presbyter would have had special duties within the college of Corinthian
presbyters that made his ministry unique. This explains the fitting analogy to
the Jewish “high priest” whose priestly ministry was ontologically identical to
that of the other Jewish priests, save for special privileges and duties.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, in the case of 1 Clement, we come full circle and
return to the observation that in the late first-century, many Churches
(especially in the West) were still using the terms “presbyter” and “bishop”
interchangeably. Yet, there is nothing in 1 Clement, or in any other patristic
source, which in any way suggests that these Churches did not possess a leading
presbyter who presided over the other presbyters.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Significantly, the ‘Levitical analogy’ is also used by St.
Athanasius of Alexandria:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">You shall see the Levites (i.e. deacons)
bringing loaves and a cup of wine, and placing them on the table. And so, long
as the prayers of supplication and entreaties have not been made, there is only
bread and wine. But after the great and wonderful prayers have been completed,
then the bread has become the Body, and the wine the Blood, of our Lord Jesus
Christ. (Athanasius, <i class="calibre4">Sermon</i> <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Newly</i> <i class="calibre4">Baptized</i>,
c. 373 A.D.)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This quote illustrates the profound connection in
traditional Christian ecclesiology, in which the sacrifices of the Jewish
Temple were equated with the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Church, and in which
the sacrificing ministerial offices of the Jewish Temple were equated with the sacrificing
ministerial offices of the Church.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">St. Paul (a short generation before Clement) made reference
to the same sacrificial mystery of the Eucharist and compared it to the Jewish
altar in 1 Corinthians 10:16-22, writing:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a
participation in the Blood of Christ? The Bread that we break, is it not a
participation in Body of Christ? Look at Israel according to the flesh; are not
those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? So, what am I saying?
That meat sacrificed to idols is anything? Or that an idol is anything? No, I
mean that what they (the pagans) sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, not to
God, and I do not want you to become participants with demons. You cannot drink
of the Cup of the Lord and also of the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the
Table of the Lord and also of the table of demons. Or are we provoking the Lord
to jealous anger?</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Both St. Paul and St. Clement are writing to the same
Corinthian Church (and within the living memories of Clement’s audience).
Hence, the sensitivity to the Eucharist as sacrifice was there, and the
ministerial parallel would have been meaningful for Clement’s readers.</p>
