<p class="msonormal1">We now arrive at an expression that is acceptable on both
sides because of its patristic use: that the Spirit proceeds (<i class="calibre4">procedit-proinai</i>)
from the Father through the Son. It should also be said that this formula is
not excluded by St. Photius’ insistence that the Spirit proceeds (<i class="calibre4">ekporev-</i>)
from the Father alone. Fr. Stylianopoulous explains:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Photios’ famous formula, “the Spirit proceeds
from the Father alone,” intends not to deny the intimate relations between the
generation of the Son and the procession of the Spirit, but only to make
utterly explicit that the Father alone causes the existence of both the Son and
the Spirit, conferring upon them all his being, attributes, and powers, except
his hypostatic property, i.e., that he is the Father, the unbegotten, the
source, origin, and cause of divinity.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">After reviewing several patristic quotations, Eastern
Orthodox apologist Thomas Valentine concludes that “through the Son” is “the
typical Eastern formula,” but with this important caveat:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The word <i class="calibre4">dia</i> never means “by” in the
sense of “by means of,” i.e. as an agent. It means through in a non-additive
sense—<i class="calibre4">dia</i> is always non-additive, referring to a tunneling or channeling
effect, like water through a pipe. Many Church Fathers use <i class="calibre4">dia</i> as a way
of expressing the relationship between the Son and the Holy Spirit—through
speaking the Word, the Father exhales the Wind/Spirit (<i class="calibre4">pnevma</i> means
both) just as a person speaking exhales wind/air when speaking words.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">There are two primary reasons for which the Orthodox insist
that the Creed of 381 should not be modified. The first one is that the Creed
of Nicea-Constantinople was the common confession of faith, so much that Pope
Leo III had it engraved on two plaques on silver and mounted in Rome. By
altering the common Creed, even without evil or heretical intent, the West
created what became a dogmatic difference in the very proclamation of Faith.
The Arian menace was soon defeated, and the pastoral need for the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>
had disappeared long before the Great Schism. The second reason is that the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>
addition goes beyond what was written in the Scriptures and by the honored
Fathers of the Second Council. There can be no doubt that the “Spirit proceeds
from the Father” as is taught by our Lord in John 15:26, but this is as far as
the Scriptures will go. Thomas Valentine (Orthodox) offers a reflection worthy
of consideration:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Unless one asserts that either the Lord Jesus
Christ spoke a superfluous repetition or that Saint John distorted the Lord’s
words and created a superfluous repetition, it is not possible to claim, as
have some supporters of the Filioque, that <span>ἐ</span><span>κ</span>π<span>ορεύεται</span>
has the same meaning as π<span>έμψω</span>.
Not only are the words etymologically different with distinct meanings, but the
phrase who from the Father proceeds uses <span>ἐ</span><span>κ</span>π<span>ορεύομαι</span>
in the present tense (<span>ἐ</span><span>κ</span>π<span>ορεύεται</span>),
indicating the proceeding of the Holy Spirit is not a future event, but a
present reality having begun in the past and still in progress. Moreover, the
fact that Saint John only uses <span>ἐ</span><span>κ</span>π<span>ορεύομαι</span>
one other time (5:9) should make the reader-interpeter aware that Saint John
may be indicating something special or unusual.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The combination of these facts makes clear that
the proceeding of the Holy Spirit is something quite different than the sending
of the Holy Spirit. Most English translations of the Holy Scriptures make the
distinction between the Son’s promise that he will send the Holy Spirit from
the Father and that the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father quite clear.
The notable exception is the Vatican-approved New American Bible which badly
distorts the passage.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, the reason for the Orthodox insistence that the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>
be removed from the Creed is in fact to foster ecclesial unity and to uphold
the Scriptural terminology of the Ecumenical text.</p>
