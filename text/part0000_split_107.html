<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Besides the manuscript evidence, some scholars appeal to
internal evidence to support their contention that Mark 16:9-20 is a scribal
addition. The case from internal evidence has three basic parts: </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">(1)</b> Mark 16:9-20 contains 17 words that are not used
in the rest of Mark. </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">(2)</b> Two words frequently used by Mark (“immediately”
and “again”) do not appear in these 12 verses. </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">(3)</b> There is no clear transition between 16:8, where
three women are on stage, so to speak, and 16:9, where Jesus appears to Mary
Magdalene, with no mention of the other two women. </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">However, the mere appearance of once-used Greek words in a
12-verse passage of Mark is not absolutely conclusive that it was not written
by Mark. As Bruce Terry has observed, there are in Mark 15:40-16:4 at least 20
Greek words that do not appear in the rest of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The second part of the case is effectively answered when one
realizes that when the entire text of Mark is sub-divided into all possible
sets of 12-verse sections (such as 1:1-12, 1:2-13, 1:3-14, and so forth), over
50% of those 12-verse sections do not contain the word “immediately,” over 60%
of them do not contain “again,” and over a third of them do not contain either
“immediately” or “again.” As Terry noted, “It is hardly an objection to say
that the last twelve verses are in the same category with more than one-third
of the sets of twelve consecutive verses in the rest of the book.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2895" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2895"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2895]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">However, the abrupt transition from the scene in 16:8 to the
one in 16:9 is not so easy to dismiss. The Greek structure of the last phrase
of 16:8 is comparable to the structure of English sentences that end with
“however.” This may be an adequate way to conclude a peripheral point at the
end of a speech, but it does not bring the scene, or the entire narrative, to a
close. The last sentence is exceptionally abrupt: Mark’s readers are led (by
14:28 and 16:7) to expect a meeting between the risen Christ and the disciples
in Galilee. This abrupt ending does not provoke reverent awe; it provokes
perplexity. Whatever difficulties exist in the view that the transition between
16:8 and 16:9 is too sudden to be deliberately made by Mark, the difficulties
that exists in the view that Mark deliberately concluded his account by
perplexing his readers are greater.</p>
