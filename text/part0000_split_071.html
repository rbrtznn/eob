<p class="msonormal1">If it is the destruction of Jerusalem that is envisioned in
Revelation, the following primary sources are of interest to be aware of the
events that took place before the fall of the city in 70 AD.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">According the Roman historian Tacitus (†117):</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[Before 70,] Prodigies had occurred… In the
sky appeared a vision of armies in conflict, of glittering armor. A sudden
lightening flash from the clouds lit up the Temple. The doors of the holy place
abruptly opened, a superhuman voice was heard to declare that the gods were
leaving it, and in the same instant came the rushing tumult of their departure.
Yet, few people placed a sinister interpretation upon this.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2411" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2411"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2411]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Jewish historian Josephus also kept a record of these
unusual events:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Thus there was a star resembling a sword, which
stood over the city, and a comet, that continued a whole year. …and at the
ninth hour of the night, so great a light shone round the altar and the holy
house, that it appeared to be bright day time; which lasted for half an hour.
This light seemed to be a good sign to the unskillful, but was so interpreted
by the sacred scribes, as to portend those events that followed immediately
upon it…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Moreover, the eastern gate of the inner [court
of the] temple, which was of brass, and vastly heavy, and had been with
difficulty shut by twenty men, and rested upon a basis armed with iron, and had
bolts fastened very deep into the firm floor, which was there made of one
entire stone, was seen to be opened of its own accord about the sixth hour of
the night… This also appeared to the vulgar to be a very happy prodigy, as if
God did thereby open them the gate of happiness. But the men of learning
understood it… So these publicly declared that the signal foreshowed the
desolation that was coming upon them.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Besides these, a few days after that feast, a
certain prodigious and incredible phenomenon appeared: I suppose the account
would seem to be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it; for, before
sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor were seen running
about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Moreover, at that feast which we call Pentecost,
as the priests were going by night into the inner court of the temple, as their
custom was, to perform their sacred ministrations, they said that, in the first
place, they felt a quaking, and heard a great noise, and after that they heard
a sound as of a great multitude, saying, “Let us leave this place!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, the Jewish Talmud also witnesses to the remarkable
phenomena that occurred in the Temple during the Yom Kippur service… There was
a strip of scarlet-dyed wool tied to the head of the scapegoat which would turn
white in the presence of the large crowd gathered at the Temple on the Day of
Atonement. The Jewish people perceived this miraculous transformation as a heavenly
sign that their sins were forgiven. The Talmud relates, however, that 40 years
before the destruction of the second Temple the scarlet colored strip of wool
did not turn white:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Rabbis taught that forty years prior to the
destruction of the Temple the lot did not come up in the [high priest’s] right
hand nor did the tongue of scarlet wool become white…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2412" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2412"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2412]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">These little known records are also useful to approach the
visions of Revelation—which may be visions of Christ himself subsequently
revealed to John—with the right balance of symbolism and historicity.</p>
