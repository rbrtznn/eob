<p class="msonormal1">Why did the Masoretes apply a formula of 100 year reduction
in six names, and not apply the same formula to Jared, Methuselah and Lamech?
One critical reason may be offered: if the Masoretes had changed Jared,
Methuselah and Lamech in line with the previous six names, this would have
brought the year of the flood down to 1356 AM (<i class="calibre4">Anno Mundi</i>), and each of
these three patriarchs would have lived past the Flood. The formula had to be
ignored for Jared, Methuselah and Lamech to avoid contradicting the date of the
Flood.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This difference in Masoretic ages - down and then up before
the flood - created a dysfunction in the pattern of ages which has been noted
by chronographers throughout history.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Column 5 shows Masoretic Lamech’s age at his death to be
1651, whereas the Flood is shown to have occurred in the year 1656, five years
after. Again, if Lamech’s age was not reduced by six years, Lamech would have
been found to have lived past the Flood by one year, which would explain why
his age had to be changed to fit in with the Flood formula. This could be
interpreted as a deliberate alteration on the part of these Masoretic scribes.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">If this is the case, it may be further suggested that these
Masoretic variations were deliberate alterations made to adhere to the new ages
of the world as prescribed in the <i class="calibre4">Sedar Olam Rabba</i> (Great Chronicle of
the World), a treatise written by the Pharisees.</p>
