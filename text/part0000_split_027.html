    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened like
this: after his mother, Mary, was promised in marriage to Joseph but before

who was a righteous man did not want to make her a public spectacle and so
intended to put her away<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn35" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref35"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[35]</span></span></span></a>

<sup class="calibre31">20</sup>But as he was thinking about these things, behold, an angel of the

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Now all this happened so that what had been

    <p class="sectiontopic">The visit of the wise men (magi)</p>

    <p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6" id="toc_14">When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of
King Herod, behold, wise men<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn41" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref41"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[41]</span></span></span></a>
from the east came to Jerusalem, saying: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>“Where is the one who is
born King of the Jews? Indeed, we have seen his star in the east and we have

him.” <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>When King Herod heard about this, he was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Gathering together all the chief priests and
scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn43" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref43"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[43]</span></span></span></a>
would be born. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>They replied, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is
written through the prophet:</p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspfirst">You Bethlehem, land of Judah, </p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">are in no way least among the rulers of Judah: </p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">for out of you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Then Herod privately<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn45" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref45"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[45]</span></span></span></a>
called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star had
appeared. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search
diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that
I also may come and express adoration to<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn46" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref46"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[46]</span></span></span></a>
him.”</p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">9</sup>After listening to the king, they continued on
their journey and behold, the star which they had seen in the east was going
ahead of them, until it came and stood over the place where the young child
was.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn47" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref47"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[47]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">10</sup>When they saw the star, they were filled with tremendous joy. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Entering
the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down
and expressed adoration to<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn48" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref48"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[48]</span></span></span></a>
him. Opening their treasures, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense and
myrrh. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>But having been warned in a dream that they should not
return to Herod, they returned to their own country using another way.</p>

    <p class="sectiontopic">The sojourn in Egypt—The massacre of the infants</p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>After they had departed, behold, an angel of
the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise! Take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn49" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref49"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[49]</span></span></span></a>
Stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy
him.” <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>So Joseph arose and took the young child and his mother by
night, and departed into Egypt. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>They remained there until the
death of Herod, so that what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet
might be fulfilled:</p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Out of Egypt I have called my son.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn50" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref50"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[50]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by
the wise men, he became extremely angry. He dispatched [his men] and killed all
the male children who lived in Bethlehem and all the surrounding countryside,
two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from
the wise men. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>And so, what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah
was fulfilled:</p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspfirst"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>A voice was heard in Ramah, </p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">lamentation,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn51" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref51"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[51]</span></b></span></span></a>
weeping and great mourning:</p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">Rachel weeping for her children. </p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">She would not be comforted, </p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">because they are no more.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn52" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref52"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[52]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the
Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream when he was in Egypt, saying: <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>“Arise!
Take the young child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel; those
who were trying to kill the young child are dead.”</p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Joseph arose and took the young child and his
mother, and they came into the land of Israel. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>However, when
Joseph heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in the place of his father
Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the
region of Galilee. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>He thus arrived and lived in a city called
Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled,
“He will be called a Nazarene.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn53" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref53"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[53]</span></span></span></a></p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6" id="toc_15">In those days, John the Baptizer was preaching in the
wilderness of Judea, saying: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>“Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is

spoken about in these words:</p>

    <p class="poetry1cxspfirst">The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn54" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref54"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[54]</span></b></span></span></a><br class="calibre6"/>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>It was peculiar about John that he wore clothing
made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was
locusts and wild honey. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Soon, people from Jerusalem, all of Judea
and the entire region around the Jordan river went out to [listen to] him. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>They
were baptized by John in the Jordan, confessing their sins. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>But
when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his
baptism, he told them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from
the wrath to come? <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Therefore, bring forth fruit worthy of
repentance! <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Do not think [that you can say] to yourselves: ‘We have
Abraham as our father!’ Truly, I tell you that from these stones, God is able

Therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is to be cut down and
cast into the fire. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>I indeed baptize you in water for repentance,
but he who comes after me is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy to carry

    <p class="sectiontopic">Theophany: The Lord’s Baptism</p>

    <p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to
