<p class="msonormal1">The first occurrence of the expression ‘catholic Church’ in the early centuries is worth considering. This significant text is found
in the Epistle of Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyneans:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Let no one do anything regarding the Church,
apart from the bishop. Let that celebration of the Eucharist be considered
valid (assured) which is held under the bishop or anyone to whom he has
committed it. <span class="calibre34">Where the bishop appears</span>, there let the people be, just as
where Jesus Christ is, <span class="calibre34">there is the catholic</span><span class="calibre34"> Church</span>. It is not permitted without authorization from the bishop either to baptize or to hold an agape;
but whatever he approves is also pleasing to God.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In this text, the catholic Church is the local Church, the gathering of the people of God around the bishop to offer the sacred
Eucharist, not a ‘universal (or worldwide) visible society founded by Christ.’
In Ignatius and for most early Christians, we have the sequence:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">CHRIST-CHURCH &gt; INCARNATION &gt; EUCHARIST
&lt;&gt; CATHOLIC CHURCH &gt; PRESIDENT-BISHOP</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is a sequence which makes perfect sense, if, like the
early Christians, we understand the Eucharist to be both a meal and a
sacrifice. If “God’s own people” is “a royal priesthood,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2741" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2741"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2741]</span></span></span></a>
and if the Lord’s Supper is an “<i class="calibre4">anamnesis</i>,”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2742" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2742"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2742]</span></span></span></a>
the logical consequence is the offering of “sacrifices.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2743" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2743"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2743]</span></span></span></a>
The resulting question is “who will offer the sacrifices on behalf of the
people?” Who will stand up in the middle of the assembly to preside over the
Eucharistic liturgy and utter the sacred words of institution? Even in the
Jewish mindset, there must be ‘an order’ by which some say the “Amen” and the
“Alleluia” while others “serve at the altar.” In the context of the Eucharist,
the Church did not choose to have a ‘randomly picked’ president of assembly or
even a ‘rotational presidency.’ In keeping with biblical pattern, one was set
aside to be the institutional celebrant. Among the presbyters, a presiding-presbyter
was elected and consecrated. The term ‘bishop’ soon became normative to refer
to that office.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2744" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2744"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2744]</span></span></span></a>
Hence, the bishop, as president of the Eucharistic assembly, is the living
symbol of the catholic Church and the guarantee of its unity.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2745" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2745"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2745]</span></span></span></a></p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418734"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418586"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267645">Presbyters and bishops</a></h3>

<p class="msonormal1">It is likely that Peter‘s role among the Apostles (<i class="calibre4">protos</i>) made him the senior-celebrant whenever the Apostles were gathered.
Every order has its <i class="calibre4">protos</i>, and Peter was that first-Apostle among the
Twelve. Likewise, the bishop (who is essentially a presbyter ‘ordered’ or
‘ordained’ as <i class="calibre4">protos</i>) occupies “the place of Peter” in the Church.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2746" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2746"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2746]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">In other words, presbyters (including the bishops) are
“priests” (<span>i`ereu.j</span>—<i class="calibre4">hiereus</i>)
in the sense that only they can offer the bloodless sacrifice on behalf of the
people. Yet, a particular presbyter is set aside as the visible and permanent
sign of unity, as Peter was set aside among the Twelve.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Regarding the relationship between <i class="calibre4">presbyteros</i> and <i class="calibre4">episcopos</i>,
two positions are possible: these two views were masterfully (albeit
subjectively) expounded at the turn of the twentieth century by Charles Biggs:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In the fourth century there were in the Church
two divergent theories of the origin of the Episcopate. The first is that of
Theodore of Mopsuestia, the second is that of St. Jerome.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Theodore starts from the observation that Bishop
and Presbyter were originally equivalent terms, and asks how the former had
come to designate a special and superior grade… According to Theodore, then,
the Episcopacy existed from the beginning, though there has been a shifting of
titles; the first bishops were specially consecrated by the Apostles and by the
Apostles alone…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">This may be called the accepted view… <span class="calibre34">The
essential point is whether the Apostles</span><span class="calibre34"> by a distinct act of
consecration instituted a distinct class of ecclesiastical officers</span> whom
they intended to step into their own places and wield their own authority.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2747" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2747"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2747]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Briggs then contrasts this view with that of St. Jerome (we have already quoted from his <i class="calibre4">Epistle to Evangelus</i>):</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">St. Jerome… also starts with the observation
that originally bishop and presbyter were convertible titles.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Presbyter, therefore, is the same as the
Bishop, and until parties arose in religion by the prompting of the devil, so
that it was said in the communities, I am of Paul, I of Apollos, I of Cephas,
the Churches were governed by the common council of the priests. But when each
teacher began to think that those whom he had baptized were his own, not
Christ’s, it was decreed throughout the world that one of the priests should be
elected and set over the others, and that on him should rest the general
supervision of the Church, so that the seeds of division might be destroyed…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">As therefore the presbyters know that <span class="calibre34">by the
custom of the Church</span> they are set under him who is put over them, so let
bishops know that <span class="calibre34">rather by custom than by the Lord’s arrangement</span> are
they greater than presbyters.’ (Commentary of Titus 1:5)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">According to Jerome, therefore, Episcopacy was
not directly instituted by our Lord, and it is clearly implied in his words
that it was not directly instituted by the Apostles. It rests upon the ‘custom
of the Church,’ and was devised by the Church for a particular object—the
maintenance of unity. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">At this point, let us clearly express our options.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Option 1: the original biblical pattern is that presbyters
and bishops are one and the same, both in terminology and in fact. If one
presbyter was elevated to a higher office (then called episcopate), this was a
practical decision of the Churches for the sake of unity, not an apostolic
institution. Depending on how strongly one feels about the authority of the
Church, this ‘change’ is more or less binding.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Option 2: the biblical terminology that equates presbyter
and bishop does not negate the fact that one presbyter was in fact the
institutional Eucharistic president of the community, i.e. the bishop.
Regardless of what title was given to this role or office, it was of apostolic
and divine origin. In this context, divine means that if Christ chose Peter to be <i class="calibre4">protos</i> (<i class="calibre4">arche</i> is not used) among the Apostles, the identification of the bishop with Peter would be based on a divine order, not
on ecclesiastical policy.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2748" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2748"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2748]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">It is true that the terms <i class="calibre4">presbyteros</i> and <i class="calibre4">episkopos</i>
were interchangeable, both in the New Testament and in 1 Clement, but we have
analyzed this issue in detail in Appendix A. Whether called ‘bishop’ or not,
there always was a presbyter designated as ‘head of the table’ for the
Eucharistic community. This office of presidency gave him a powerful
representative and symbolic role: the bishop stood at the altar on behalf of
the clergy and people. Christ and the Church intersected in his personal office
because the people are ‘Christ’ and the bishop speaks on behalf of the Great
High Priest the words of institution.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">What remains somewhat of a mystery is the nature of the
relationship between the <i class="calibre4">protos</i> and his fellow-presbyters. As Jerome rightly remarked, a presbyter can do everything a bishop does except ordain. As
early as the third century, the <i class="calibre4">Apostolic Tradition</i> of Hippolytus of Rome makes the distinction between the authority of the presbyter to “seal” and that of
the bishop to actually “ordain:”</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">When one ordains a deacon, he is chosen
according to what has been said above, with only the bishop laying on his hand
in the same manner. In the ordination of a deacon, only the bishop lays on his
hand, because the deacon is not ordained to the priesthood, but to the service
of the bishop, to do that which he commands… Upon the presbyters, the other
presbyters place their hands because of a common spirit and similar duty.
Indeed, the presbyter has only the authority to receive this, but he has no
authority to give it. Therefore he does not ordain to the clergy. Upon the
ordination of the presbyter he seals; the bishop ordains.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2749" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2749"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2749]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, the bishop is first among equals, but in a way that
gives him unique privileges, indeed powers, in the Church and “on behalf of the
Church.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2750" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2750"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2750]</span></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the bishop depends on other bishops to perform an episcopal
consecration, and likewise needs the assent of the <i class="calibre4">presbyterium</i> and the
people:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">With the assent of all, the bishops will place
their hands upon him, with the council of presbyters standing by, quietly…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2751" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2751"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2751]</span></span></span></a></p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418735"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418587"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267646">Summary</a></h3>

<p class="msonormal1">The need to have an established presiding presbyter at the
head of the Eucharistic assembly is obvious for practical reasons. It seems
equally evident that the early Christians, following the apostolic pattern for
Jerusalem, did not opt for a ‘rotational’ type of Eucharistic presidency. Just
as Peter, an apostle, had status of <i class="calibre4">protos</i> and the privilege to preside
whenever the Twelve were gathered,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2752" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2752"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2752]</span></span></span></a>
likewise a presbyter was designated to have this special role (as “bishop”).</p>
