<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">We could also consider additional evidence for the ending at
16:8. Besides Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus, two non-Greek copies — the
Sinaitic Syriac manuscript (from the late 300s or early 400s), and a copy in
the ancient Egyptian Sahidic language (from c. 425) – also conclude the Gospel
of Mark at the end of 16:8. The text of the Sahidic version is closely related to
the text of Codex Vaticanus.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">We now turn our attention to the Shorter Ending which reads:
“And everything that had been told to them, they reported to Peter and his
companions. And after this, Jesus himself [appeared to them and], from east
[even] unto west, sent forth through them the sacred and imperishable Gospel of
eternal salvation.” This two-sentence ending is found between 16:8 and 16:9 in Codex
L (produced in the 700s, probably in Egypt), Codex <span>Ψ</span>, Codex 083, Codex 099, Codex 579, and
in the lower margin of Codex 274. It is also found in 131 Ethiopic copies, and
in some other non-Greek copies from Egypt.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The Shorter Ending appears to have been created by a copyist
in order to make the ending of Mark less abrupt than it would be if it ended at
the end of 16:8. This implies that the copies that contain it – Greek and
non-Greek copies – descend from an ancestor-manuscript in which Mark ended at
16:8. Thus all the witnesses for the Shorter Ending appear to indirectly
support the abrupt ending at 16:8. The only other possibility is that the
Shorter Ending was originally not an ending at all, but rather an interpolation
(a flourish to a reading-unit) that otherwise ended at 16:8. However, the Old
Latin Codex Bobiensis (from c. 430) also contains the Shorter Ending without
16:9-20, and annotations in Codex L and a few of the other copies make it clear
that the Shorter Ending once stood in some Greek copies by itself after 16:8.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In summary, the evidence for the Shorter Ending can be
traced back to the late 300s, and there are no clear signs of its existence
before that time. All the witnesses for its existence, in Greek and non-Greek
copies alike, do not necessarily say anything about the history of the text of
Mark before the late 300s; nor do they shed light upon the history of the text
of Mark outside Egypt at that time.</p>
