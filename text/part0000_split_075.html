<p class="msonormal1">The position of historic orthodox catholic Christianity on
the monarchical episcopate is that the three-fold office of bishop, presbyter,
and deacon has existed in the Church since the earliest times and that it was
established by the Apostles themselves. In opposition to this, numerous
Protestant (as well as liberal Roman Catholic) historians have suggested that
the earliest Apostolic Churches were not governed by monarchical bishops (in
which one man served as the chief shepherd of the Church), but were rather
governed by a college of absolutely co-equal presbyters. Indeed, a first-glance
reading of the earliest patristic evidence may lead to such a conclusion. For
instance, as seen in the New Testament literature itself, it is an indisputable
fact that the <b class="calibre7">earliest Christians used the terms “bishop” (“overseer”) and
“presbyter” (“elder”) interchangeably</b>:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Titus 1:5-7: For this reason, I left you in
Crete so that you might set right what remains to be done and appoint
presbyters in every town, as I directed you, on condition that a man be
blameless, married only once, with believing children who are not accused of
licentiousness or rebellious. For a bishop, as God’s steward, must be
blameless, not arrogant…” (See also: 1 Tim 3:1-7; 5:17-22)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Acts 20:17-28: From Miletus he (Paul) had the
presbyters of the Church of Ephesus summoned. When they came to him, he
addressed them… “Keep watch over yourselves and over the whole flock of which
the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers, in which you tend the Church of
God…”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Moreover, in the earliest patristic literature (especially
when it applies to the Western ‘city-Churches,’ such as the Church of Rome), we
notice several references to “the presbyters” (plural) but not explicitly to a
monarchical bishop. Indeed, it is not until the writings of St. Ignatius of
Antioch (c. 107 AD, about ten years after the death of the last Apostle) that
we see someone clearly distinguishing between “the bishop” and “the presbyters”
who assist him in governing the catholic Church. However, even in this case,
Ignatius only speaks of monarchical bishops when writing to several communities
in the province of Asia (in the East). When writing to the Romans, Ignatius
does not mention a “bishop” for that city-Church at all. As a result, some
conclude that the office of monarchical bishop was an Eastern novelty that
developed in the days of Ignatius, and that Rome and the West were governed by
colleges of co-equal presbyters into the second century. Indeed, the
inclination of Protestant apologists to deny the existence of monarchical
bishops in Apostolic times cannot be surprising, since discrediting the
monarchical episcopate was both a key and essential objective of the Protestant
Reformation, without which the Reformation could not possibly have succeeded.
Unlike previous schisms in ecclesiastical history, Protestantism was not a
movement initiated by legitimate bishops. Rather, the main Protestant leaders
were either Roman Catholic priests (e.g. Martin Luther) or deacons (e.g. John
Calvin), with no bishops among them to confer some kind of ‘episcopal
authority’ to their doctrines.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In point of fact, at the tail end of the Reformation, a few
Roman Catholic bishops did join the Elizabethan ‘Church of England;’ but, by
that time, the denial of a special episcopal charism was already a
universally-established tenet of the Reformation; so much so that, at the
ordination of Matthew Parker (Queen Elizabeth’s first truly-Protestant
Archbishop of Canterbury), an ordained Roman Catholic priest (now-Protestant)
and two Low Church ministers (laymen) participated in the consecration as equal
partners with Bishop Barlow (who had also gone over to Protestantism). Hence,
the idea of a “college of presbyters” was very clear in their minds, and actual
episcopal authority was something to be rejected.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Thus, Protestant theology is very eager to disprove the
existence of the monarchic episcopate, not as a purely academic disagreement
about Church history, but as an extremely important part of its theological and
organizational system.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Let us now review the historical data. Although there is no
direct reference to a monarchical bishop in the earliest patristic evidence, it
would be erroneous to conclude that no monarchical bishops existed. In fact, <b class="calibre7">the
evidence points to a change in Christian semantics</b>, with the term “bishop”
beginning to be used for the leading presbyter of a city-Church, especially as
his importance became increasingly apparent during the heresy battles at the
end of the first century. In other words, the apostolic city-Churches always
possessed leading presbyters who functioned as permanent <i class="calibre4">ex-officio</i>
presidents of the Eucharistic assembly and who presided over their
fellow-presbyters (e.g. James at Jerusalem; Timothy at Ephesus; Titus at Crete,
etc). Yet, these leading/presiding presbyters were not singled out or referred
to exclusively as “bishops” until the latter half of the first century.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In New Testament times, the terms “bishop” (“overseer”) and
“presbyter” (“elder”) were still being used interchangeably (e.g. Titus 1:5-7).
Thus, in the original Christian usage, all “elders” were “overseers,” and all
“overseers” were “elders.” “Elder” referred to their qualifications whereas
“overseer” emphasized their function as shepherds of the flock.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">It was only in the time of St. Ignatius of Antioch that the
term “overseer” was exclusively assigned to the leading presbyter of the
Church, as opposed to being applied to all the other presbyters as well. Hence,
we see a change in semantics between the terminology of St. Ignatius and the
terminology of St. Paul (author of Titus) or St. Luke (author of Acts), who
wrote a generation earlier. Undoubtedly, a change in semantics did occur, but
the evidence shows that <b class="calibre7">the underlying organization of the Church did not change</b>.</p>
