<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><b class="calibre7">The first hypothesis to be tested is that Luke did not
include this second Cainan</b> but that a very early copyist accidentally
repeated <span>ΤΟΥΚΑΙΝΑΝ</span>
(the son of Cainan), as in:</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΣΑΡΟΥΧΤΟΥΡΑΓΑΥΤΟΥΦΑΛΕΓΤΟΥΕΒΕΡΤΟΥΣΑΛΑ</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΑΡΦΑΞΑΔΤΟΥΣΗΜΤΟΥΝΩΕΤΟΥΛΑΜΕΧ</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΜΑΘΟΥΣΑΛΑΤΟΥΕΝΩΧΤΟΥΙΑΡΕΔΤΟΥΜΑΛΕΛΕΗΛ<span class="calibre34">ΤΟΥΚΑΙΝΑΝ</span></span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΕΝΩΣΤΟΥΣΗΘΤΟΥΑΔΑΜΤΟΥΘΕΟΥ</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">becoming:</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΣΑΡΟΥΧΤΟΥΡΑΓΑΥΤΟΥΦΑΛΕΓΤΟΥΕΒΕΡΤΟΥΣΑΛΑ<span class="calibre34">ΤΟΥΚΑΙΝΑΝ</span></span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΑΡΦΑΞΑΔΤΟΥΣΗΜΤΟΥΝΩΕΤΟΥΛΑΜΕΧ</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΜΑΘΟΥΣΑΛΑΤΟΥΕΝΩΧΤΟΥΙΑΡΕΔΤΟΥΜΑΛΕΛΕΗΛ<span class="calibre34">ΤΟΥΚΑΙΝΑΝ</span></span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span class="calibre8">ΤΟΥΕΝΩΣΤΟΥΣΗΘΤΟΥΑΔΑΜΤΟΥΘΕΟΥ</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In English, this becomes:</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">“the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son
of Eber, the son of Shelah, <span class="calibre34">the son of Cainan</span>,</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the
son of Lamech,</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared,
the son of Mahalalel, <span class="calibre34">the son of Cainan</span>,</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son
of God.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The main issue with this theory is that all MSS of Luke (with
two exceptions) contain the second Cainan, which is why all English
translations also include this second Cainan. The two exceptions are D (Codex
Bezae) which is notoriously unreliable, especially in Luke, and P75 which does
not only omit the name Cainan from Luke 3:36, but also all of Luke 3:23 to 3:33.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2901" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2901"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2901]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The second issue – the fact that our LXX manuscripts contain
the second Cainan – may be overcome by suggesting that the Christian copyists
of the LXX would have decided to insert the second Cainan to conform with their
copies of Luke 3:36. It is impossible to tell what all the earlist
pre-Christian LXX manuscripts read, but there are reasons to believe that the
second Cainan has pre-Lukan origins. Jared L. Olar comments:</p>

<p class="msoquote">The Jewish historian Demetrius, who lived in the 200s B.C.
around the same time that the Septuagint translation was beginning to be
prepared, also included the second Cainan. The writings of Demetrius are lost,
but some of his statements were preserved by Alexander Polyhistor, who lived around
the time that Christ was born. Like Demetrius, Polyhistor also included the
second Cainan.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2902" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2902"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2902]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The Book of the Jubilees (c. 100 BC) also includes the
second Cainan, albeit with a different age for his begetting of Salah. This is
significant because several fragments of ‘Jubilees’ were found among the Dead
Sea Scrolls. In an attempt to explain the possible origin of the divergence
between the ‘1 and 2 Cainan’ streams, Jared L. Olar suggests:</p>

<p class="msoquote">[The] second Cainan was known to Jewish writers as early as
the 200s B.C., while it is only with Philo Judaeus in the early first century
A.D. that we have evidence of the absence of this name from Abraham’s
genealogy. What is likely to have happened is that at some point between 200
B.C. and the birth of Christ, a scribe must have accidentally skipped over the
second Cainan in Gen. 11, thus creating a family or tradition of manuscript
copies that left him out. In time, scribes who were confused by the second
Cainan’s absence from Gen. 11 but presence in Gen. 10 and I Chron. 1 would have
begun to “correct” their copies by deleting him from Gen. 10 and I Chron. 1.
This would explain why the Septuagint, Demetrius, Polyhistor, and Jubilees
include the second Cainan, while Philo, Josephus, Africanus, the Vulgate, and
the Masoretic omit him. Because St. Luke followed the Septuagint, his genealogy
includes the second Cainan.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This reasoning does not convince other scholars and
apologists who support the view that the second Cainan was introduced in the
LXX after 220 AD, on the basis of Josephus, Africanus,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2903" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2903"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2903]</span></span></span></a>
P75, and D.</p>
