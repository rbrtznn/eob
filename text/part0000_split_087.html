<p class="msonormal1">John 15:26 is the key text for the theological issue of the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>
which was and remains a major cause of debate and disagreement between
Orthodoxy and Western Christianity.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Historically, we can discern a possible pattern of evolution
for so-called Latin and Greek theology. If we consider the case of
ecclesiology, what the East considers ‘economical’ or ‘functional’ tends to be
seen as ‘ontological’ and ‘dogmatic’ in the West. This is the case with
universal ecclesiology and primacy: the functional utility of a universal
primate is understood as theological and dogmatic in Roman Catholicism.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2824" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2824"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2824]</span></span></span></a>
To an extent, the question of clerical celibacy can be examined in the same
light: the functional ideal of having undivided clerics available to offer the
Eucharist every day and to serve with the greatest possible freedom led to the
quasi-dogmatization and ‘essentialization’ of celibacy in the West.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">When we turn to other theological issues, notably the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>,
it could be argued that the economic procession or ‘missions’ of the Spirit
‘from the Son’ or ‘through the Son’ has also been understood as an ontological
truth in the West. Both Greeks and Latins agreed that the economy or missions
of the Holy Spirit are from the Father through the Son, as is clear in
Scripture. In an outstanding article on the Trinity written by Paul Owen, this
distinction is well explained:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">First of all, mainstream Christians distinguish
between the Trinitarian economy of God, and the Trinitarian ontology of God.
What does that mean? These terms are an attempt to come to grips with two
aspects of God’s relationship to the world: his otherness (transcendence), and
his presence in the world (immanence). God is not, in his essence, a part of
the space-time continuum which we might designate the “created order.” It is
necessary to distinguish between the Life of God, which is grounded in Divine
Sovereignty (Exodus 3:14), and the life of the contingent world.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2825" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2825"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2825]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The question, then, is how the ‘functional’ operations of
God in our world relate to the eternal, ontological question of the
‘begotten-ness’ of the son and ‘procession’ of the Spirit.</p>
