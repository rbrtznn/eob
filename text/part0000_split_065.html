<p class="sectiontopic">Reason for writing</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you
about our common salvation, I felt it needful to write to you in order to
encourage you to fight hard for the faith which was once for all delivered to
the saints. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Indeed, there are certain men who have secretly crept
in, people whose condemnation was announced long ago. They are ungodly men who
turn the grace of our God into indecency, and they deny our only Master<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2394" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2394"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2394]</span></span></span></a>

Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Lessons from the Old Testament</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Even though you already know this, I wish to
remind you that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, later
on destroyed<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2396" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2396"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2396]</span></span></span></a>
those who did not believe! <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>The angels who did not keep their first
domain but deserted their own dwelling place, he has also kept in darkness and
eternal chains for the judgment of the great day. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Likewise, Sodom,
Gomorrah, and the cities around them had given themselves over to sexual
immorality and unnatural relations<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2397" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2397"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2397]</span></span></span></a>
in the same way as these angels. They are presented as an example, suffering
the punishment of eternal fire. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Yet, these people do the same
thing: in their delusion, they degrade the flesh, despise authority, and
slander the glorious beings. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>But the archangel Michael, when he
struggled with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare to
bring against the devil an evil-speaking judgment, but said, “May the Lord
rebuke you!”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2398" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2398"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2398]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Yet, these people speak evil of things they know nothing about.
What they do understand (by natural power, like the creatures without reason),
these things will destroy them. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Woe to them! They have followed
the path of Cain, they have thrown themselves after the error of Balaam for the
sake of money, and they have perished in Korah’s rebellion. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>These
people are like hidden and rocky reefs in your agape meals, when they feast
with you. They are shepherds who feed themselves without fear, clouds without
water carried along by winds, autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted.
<sup class="calibre31">13</sup>They are wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
wandering stars, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved unto the age.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2399" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2399"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2399]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">14</sup>About these people, Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied,
saying:<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2400" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2400"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2400]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">Behold, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his
holy ones,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>to execute judgment on all,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">and to convict all the ungodly among them<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2401" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2401"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2401]</span></b></span></span></a>
of all their works of ungodliness</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">which they have done in an ungodly way,</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspmiddle">and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have
spoken against him.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>These [people] are grumblers and complainers
who pursue their [own] lusts, and their mouth speaks proud things. [They only]
show respect to people in order to gain an advantage.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Recalling the apostolic teachings</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>As for you, beloved, remember the words which
have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>They
said to you that “in the last time there will be mockers, walking after their
own ungodly lusts.” <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>These [scoffers] are the ones who cause
divisions, because they are sensual and deprived of the Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>But
you, beloved, keep building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in
the Holy Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for
the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ [that leads] to eternal life. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Have
compassion on some of them, [but] make a distinction.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2402" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2402"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2402]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">23</sup>You can save some of them, snatching them out of the fire with
fear,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2403" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2403"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2403]</span></span></span></a>
yet hating even the clothing stained by what is carnal.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Now to him who is able to keep them<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2404" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2404"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2404]</span></span></span></a>
from stumbling and to present [them] blameless before the presence of his glory
in great joy, <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>to God our Savior who alone is wise,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2405" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2405"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2405]</span></span></span></a>
be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and to all ages. Amen.</p>
