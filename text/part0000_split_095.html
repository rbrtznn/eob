<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">It may be useful to mention that the ‘shadow of Arianism’—and the fear thereof—may be more of a factor than is often realized. For various
reasons, what we call the Western tradition has tended to theologize on the
opposite extreme of Arianism. The early tendencies of the Roman Church were on
the Modalistic side, and it is in Reformed/Protestant Western Christianity that
we find such aberrations as ‘Oneness’ theology and the triple <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i>
of John Calvin.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">It is revealing that the issue of Arianism is addressed several times in Mark Bonocore’s extensive <i class="calibre4">Response to Eastern
Orthodox Objections</i>. At one point, the Roman Catholic apologist writes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[The <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>] was included in the Creed
by the Western fathers at Toledo in order to counter the claims of the 6th
Century Spanish (Germanic) Arians. These Arians were of course denying this
essential and orthodox truth—that is, the Son’s eternal participation in the
Spirit’s procession.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">But Arianism<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2843" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2843"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2843]</span></span></span></a>
had nothing to do with the question of the Spirit’s procession: the only truth
debated with the Arians was the uncreated nature and eternality of the Logos.
What Bonocore calls an “essential and orthodox truth” so dear to the West is in
fact a complex and delicate subject of discussion. His <i class="calibre4">Response</i>
continues:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">It is of course quite disturbing (from the
Western perspective) that modern Eastern Orthodox (i.e., Photian) theology
comes very close to advocating this same Arian view by refusing to incorporate
the Son’s participation in the Spirit’s eternal procession in any way.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">However, the Photian position does no such thing, and if it
did, it would simply be the affirmation that the ontological procession of the
meaning of the mind has its total cause and origin in the mind, independently
from the word.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Fr. Romanides also noticed this lingering concern with
Arianism in the writings of St. Augustine:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Augustine was completely obsessed by the Arian
argument that proof that the Logos of the Father is created is the fact that He
appeared to the Prophets and Patriarchates of the Old Testament and the
prophets and Apostles of the New Testament.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2844" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2844"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2844]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Indeed, Cappadocian-Orthodoxy is sometimes perceived with
concern by Westerners. As Paul Owen expressed very clearly:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Hence there is an element of ontological
subordinationism<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2845" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2845"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2845]</span></span></span></a>
which remains in the Eastern view, which in the mind of those inclined toward
the view of the Western tradition, leaves the door open to implicit Arianism…</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This is why Metropolitan John Zizioulas felt compelled to
insist:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Orthodox theology is especially clear on this
emphasis on “the <span lang="EN">simplicity of the Most High” (Photius</span><span lang="EN">) because it has no fear of the absurd accusation of Arianism</span><span lang="EN">.</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Eastern Orthodoxy insists that the teaching of the First and
Second Ecumenical Councils is correct in affirming that the unity of God is in
the <i class="calibre4">autotheos</i> Father who eternally begets His Word and spirates His
Spirit, so that their divinity is indeed derived. However, this language makes
Western theologians uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In dealing with John 14:28 (“The Father is greater than I
am”), Western theologians are reluctant to mention the Monarchy of Father and
the derivative divinity of the Son as the first and best explanation, or indeed
that such was the exegesis offered by all the great Eastern fathers:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Son says not, “My Father is better than I,”
lest we should conceive him to be foreign to his nature, but “greater,” not
indeed in greatness nor in time, but because of his generation from the Father
himself. (Athanasius, <i class="calibre4">Orations against the Arians</i>, 1.58)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Since the Son’s origin (arche) is from the
Father, in this respect the Father is greater, as cause and origin. Wherefore
also the Lord said thus, “My Father is greater than I,” clearly inasmuch as He
is Father. Yea, what else does the word Father signify unless the being cause
and origin of that which is begotten of Him? (Basil, <i class="calibre4">Against Eunomius</i>,
1.25)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Superior greatness belongs to the cause,
equality to the nature…. To say that [the Father] is greater than [the Son]
conceived as man is certainly true, but no great thing to say. For what marvel
is it if God is greater than man? (Gregory of Nazianzus, <i class="calibre4">Oration</i>, 30.7)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">If any one say that the Father is greater in so
far as He is the cause of the Son, we will not gainsay this. But this, however,
does not make the Son to be of a different essence. (John Chrysostom, <i class="calibre4">Homilies</i>, 70)<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2846" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2846"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2846]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In contrast, discussing the imaginary problem posed by this
text, the bulletin of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lincoln offers this typical
‘Augustinian’ answer:<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2847" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2847"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2847]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Jesus was speaking of his coming ascension into
heaven and thus He was talking about His created human nature, when He is
recorded to have said in the Gospel according to St. John, “The Father is
greater than I.” As man, the Father is greater, but as God, He and the Father
are one (John 8:21- 58; Matthew 16:16-17; Matthew 26:63-66).<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2848" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2848"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2848]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">However, modern Arians (Jehovah’s Witnesses) or the sincere
seeker always realizes that this ‘interpretation’ of John 14:28 is weak: of
course, the Father is greater that the Son in his human nature: such an obvious
and meaningless statement would have no place in Our Lord’s discourse. What is
wrong, in the Western mind, with the explanation provided by St. Gregory the
Theologian? It seems that the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> theology of the Latin tradition
(with its mental representation as a <span>6</span>)
has a hard time affirming the patristic Monarchy of the Father’s person (with
its mental representation as a <span>5</span>). In
that sense, it is not the Byzantine-political model which is at stake in the
mind of Eastern Orthodoxy as Marc Bonocore suggests; it is the theology and
intent of the Fathers of the Second Ecumenical Council. The Latin Creed begins
by following the original at every line. However, without any warning sign, as
Mark Bonocore admits, “the introduction of the Filioque is clearly a departure from the original intention and design of the A.D. 381 version of the
Constantinopolitan Creed.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Is it not conceivable that the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i> is the
symptom of lingering Modalism and ‘crypto-triple autotheism?’ This heretical
drift, presented under the label of ‘historical trinitarianism’ is especially
noticeable among Evangelical Protestants.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">There is a real concern, then, that Western trinitarianism,
whose historical banner is the <i class="calibre4">filioque</i>, has abandoned the Fathers of
the First and Second Ecumenical Councils along with their careful and balanced
biblical theology. The reader should be aware that these elements are crucial
and often ignored.</p>
