<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">John 1:18 presents a double difficulty. The first aspect is
that the original Greek is debated. Several ancient manuscripts read <span>monogenh.j qeo.j</span> (“only-begotten or
unique God”) instead of <span>monogenh.j
ui`o.j </span>(“only-begotten or unique son”). Inasmuch as the Critical Text
gives preponderance to the so-called Alexandrian textual tradition, it adopts<span> qeo.j</span> as the most likely original
reading of John 1:18. This reading is also cited by Irenaeus<sup class="calibre31"> </sup>(Latin
text), Clement (2 out of 4 citations), Origen, Arius, Hilary, Basil, Gregory of
Nyssa, Jerome and Cyril.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">On the other hand, Byzantine manuscripts always read <span>monogenh.j ui`o.j </span>which is
therefore the reading found in the Patriarchal Text and the main text of the
EOB. The witnesses supporting this reading are geographically widespread and it
is consistent with Johannine usage (3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9).</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Hence, it is extremely difficult to be certain as to the
original reading of this passage, but it is clear that both <span>monogenh.j qeo.j </span>and <span>monogenh.j ui`o.j </span>are consistent
with John 1:1 and that they do not create any doctrinal issues.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The second difficulty of John 1:18 is the ongoing debate
over the proper translation of <span>monogenh.j</span>.
</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The King James Version rendered this Greek word as “only
begotten,” but contemporary research in the usage of <span>monogenh.j</span> seems to indicate that a better rendition
would be “uniquely-loved-and-begotten” or “uniquely loved on account of [one’s]
origin,” which is sometimes simplified as “unique” or “only.” This is also
close in meaning to “one and only of its kind,” but this has to be clarified by
the fact that <span>monogenh.j</span> is
always used in the context of a parent-child relationship. Based on various
interpretations and grammatical options, modern scholars and translations have
adopted a variety of renditions, including:</p>

<ul type="square" class="calibre33">
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6">The only-begotten God (NASB)</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6">God, only-begotten (Westcott)</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6">God the only Son (TCNT, NAB1, NIV1973,1978, NRSV)</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6">The only son, God (NAB2)</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6">The divine only Son (Goodspeed)</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6">God the one and only (NIV1984)</li>
 <li class="body-list align-justify mt-6">The only One, who is the same as God (GNB1966, 1971).</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The problem here is that while “only-begotten” makes it
clear that the Son has his source and origin in the Father, “unique” and “one
and only” tend to hide this important aspect of historic orthodox theology,
sometimes intentionally so.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2822" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2822"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2822]</span></span></span></a>
At the same time, “only-begotten” may also be misleading by directing the
reader to the idea that the “only-begotten” is the only one who is a son or who
has been “begotten” or “obtained.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">For these reasons, the EOB translates <span>monogenh.j ui`o.n</span> as
“uniquely-begotten” and provides an explanatory footnote.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">As Metropolitan John (Zizioulas) of Pergamon writes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">God the Father loves uniquely only one Person,
that is his Son. The adjective <span>monogenh.j</span>,
with which the Father refers to his Son (Jn 1:14-18; 3:16), does not mean
simply the ‘only-begotten’ but also the ‘uniquely loved one’ (<span>o` avgaphto,j</span>; Mt. 3:17; 12.18; 2
Pet. 1.17; etc.). It is in and through and because of him that the Father loves
all the beings that exist, for he made them ‘in him’ and ‘for him’ (Col.
1.16-18). (John D. Zizioulas—<i class="calibre4">Communion and Otherness</i>, p. 73-74)</p>
