<p class="sectiontopic">Great and greater blessedness</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">27</sup>As Jesus was saying these things, a woman<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn795" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref795"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[795]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>As the crowds were increasing, he began to say,
“This is an evil generation; it asks for a sign. No sign will be given to it

<sup class="calibre31">32</sup>The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this

Jonah, and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The lamp of the body</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">33</sup>No one who has lit a lamp puts it in a cellar

your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is
full of darkness! <sup class="calibre31">35</sup>And so, see whether the light that is in you is
not darkness. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>If your whole body is full of light, having no dark

<p class="sectiontopic">About the Pharisees</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">37</sup>Now as Jesus was speaking these things, a
certain Pharisee asked him to have dinner with him. Jesus went in and reclined
at the table. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>When the Pharisee saw it, he was astonished that

said to him, “You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and platter, but your inside

justice and the love of God. You should have done these while not leaving the
other undone. <sup class="calibre31">43</sup>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in
the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces. <sup class="calibre31">44</sup>Woe to you,

You are like hidden graves, and people who walk over them do not [even] know
it.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">45</sup>One of the experts in the law exclaimed, “Teacher,
in saying this you insult us also.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">46</sup>Jesus said, “Woe to you lawyers also! For you
load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves will not
even lift one finger to help carry those burdens! <sup class="calibre31">47</sup>Woe to you! For
you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. <sup class="calibre31">48</sup>And

were entering.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">53</sup>As he said these things to them, the scribes
and Pharisees began a furious attack on him and tried to force answers from him
on many questions. <sup class="calibre31">54</sup>They were lying in wait for him, seeking to
catch him in something he might say, <a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn804" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref804"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[804]</span></span></span></a>in

<p class="msonormal1">Meanwhile, a crowd of many thousands had gathered, to the

Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, [although] before this, they had
been enemies.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Pilate condemns the Lord to be crucified</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Pilate called together the chief priests, the
rulers, and the people. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>He said to them, “You brought this man to
me as someone who perverts the people, and behold, I did not find this man
guilty of any of your charges against him. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Neither has Herod, for
I sent you back to him<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn942" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref942"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[942]</span></span></span></a>.
As you can see, this man has done nothing worthy of death! <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Therefore,
I will punish him and [then] release him.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>&lt;Now Pilate had to release one prisoner to
them at the feast.&gt;<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn943" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref943"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[943]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">18</sup>But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man!
Release Barabbas to us!”<sup class="calibre31">19</sup>This one had been thrown into prison for a
certain rebellion<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn944" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref944"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[944]</span></span></span></a>
in the city, and for murder.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Then Pilate addressed them once more, desiring
to release Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>But they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify
him!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>For the third time, Pilate said to them, “Why?
What evil has this man done? I have found nothing worthy of death in him. I
will therefore chastise him and release him.” <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>But they were
insistent with loud voices, demanding that Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn945" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref945"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[945]</span></span></span></a>
be crucified. And their shouts and the shouts of the chief priests prevailed. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>So
Pilate decreed that what they were asking for should be done. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>He
released Barabbas, who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder,
as the people had requested. But Jesus he delivered up to their will.</p>

Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me!
Instead, weep for yourselves and for your children! <sup class="calibre31">29</sup>For behold,

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>One of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>“What things?” he asked to them.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">They replied, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene! He

And they came back saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said
that he was alive! <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just
as the women had said, but they did not see him.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">25</sup>He said to them, “You foolish men! So slow of
heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>Did not the

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>“Stay with us!” they urged him, saying, “It is
almost evening, and the day is almost over!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">So he went in to stay with them. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Now it
happened that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread

another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us along the
way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>They rose up that
very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together and
[also] those who were with them. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>They were saying, “The Lord is
