<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>At once, the Spirit drove him out into the

by Satan. He was with the wild animals and the angels were ministering<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn411" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref411"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[411]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Now after John had been arrested, Jesus came
into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God, <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>and
saying, “The time is fulfilled! The Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent and
believe in the Good News.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>As he walked by the sea of Galilee, Jesus saw
Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were
fishermen. <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you
fishers of men.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Immediately, they left their nets and followed
him. <sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Going on a little farther from there, he saw James the son of
Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in a boat, mending the nets. <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>At
once, he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the
hired servants, and they began to follow him. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>They went into
Capernaum, and on the Sabbath day, Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn413" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref413"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[413]</span></span></span></a>
entered into the synagogue and taught. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>The people were astonished
at his teaching because he taught them as having authority, not like the
scribes. <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean
spirit who cried out, <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>“Away! What do we have to do with you,
Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy
One of God!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come
out of him!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>The unclean spirit, convulsing the man and
crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>The people were all so
amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching? For with
authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” <sup class="calibre31">28</sup>The

<p class="sectiontopic">The healing of Peter’s mother in law—Other healings</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>As soon as they left the synagogue, they came
into the house of Simon and Andrew, [along] with James and John. <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Now
Simon’s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately, they told him
about her. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>Jesus came, took her by the hand, and raised her up.
The fever left her and she began to serve them. <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>At evening, when
the sun had set, they brought him all who were sick or possessed by demons. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>The
entire city was gathered at the door. <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>He healed many who were
afflicted with various diseases and cast out many demons. However, he did not
allow the demons to speak because they knew him to be the Christ<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn416" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref416"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[416]</span></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">35</sup>Early in the morning, while it was still dark,
Jesus arose, left the house, went out into a deserted place and prayed there. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>Simon
and those with him followed Jesus.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn417" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref417"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[417]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">37</sup>When they found him, they told him, “Everyone is looking for you!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">38</sup>He replied, “Let us go into the next towns, so that
I may preach there also, for this is why I came.” <sup class="calibre31">39</sup>And he was
preaching in their synagogues throughout all of Galilee, casting out demons.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The healing of a leper</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">40</sup>A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down
before him, and saying, “If you want to, you can make me clean!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">41</sup>Being moved with compassion,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn418" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref418"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[418]</span></span></span></a>
Jesus stretched out his hand, touched the man, and said to him, “I want to! Be
made clean.” <sup class="calibre31">42</sup>When Jesus said this, the leprosy immediately
departed from the leper<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn419" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref419"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[419]</span></span></span></a>
and he was made clean. <sup class="calibre31">43</sup>Jesus strictly warned him, and sent him out
at once, <sup class="calibre31">44</sup>saying, “See that you do not say anything to anyone, but
go and show yourself to the priest. Offer for your cleansing what Moses instructed,
as a testimony to them.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">45</sup>However, the man went off and began to proclaim
it freely and to spread news about this matter, so that Jesus could no longer
enter into a city openly. Instead, he remained outside in deserted places and
people came to him from everywhere.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The healing of a paralytic</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="msonormal1">After some time, when Jesus returned to Capernaum, it was
heard that he was in the house. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Immediately, many people gathered
so that there was no more room, not even around the door. As Jesus was
preaching the word to them, <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>four men came, carrying a paralytic to
him. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Since they could not come near Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn420" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref420"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[420]</span></span></span></a>
because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken
it up, they let down the mat which the paralytic was lying on. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Seeing
their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins have been forgiven
you.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>But there were some of the scribes sitting
there, and they reasoned in their hearts, <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>“Why does this man speak
blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins except God alone?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Immediately, Jesus perceived in his spirit that
they were reasoning within themselves in this way. He asked them, “Why do you
reason these things in your hearts? <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Which is easier, to tell the
paralytic, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Arise, take up your bed,
and walk?’ <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>But so that you may know that the Son of Man has
authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—<sup class="calibre31">11</sup>“I
tell you, arise and take up your mat, and go to your house!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>At once, the man arose and took up the mat, and
went out in front of everyone. The people were all amazed and glorified God,
saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The calling of Levi (Matthew)—About fasting</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Jesus went out again by the seaside. The crowd
came to him and he taught them. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>As Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn421" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref421"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[421]</span></span></span></a>
was passing by, he saw Levi,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn422" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref422"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[422]</span></span></span></a>
the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow
me!” And Levi arose and followed Jesus.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>It then happened that Jesus was reclining at
the table in Levi’s house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with
Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>The
scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn423" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref423"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[423]</span></span></span></a>
was eating with tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, “Why is it
that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>When Jesus heard it, he replied to them, “Those
who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. I came
not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn424" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref424"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[424]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were
fasting, and they came to ask him, “Why do the disciples of John and of the
Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Jesus told them, “Can the guests of the wedding<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn425" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref425"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[425]</span></span></span></a>
fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom
with them, they cannot fast! <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.
<sup class="calibre31">21</sup>No one sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment, or else the
patch shrinks and tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made. <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>No
one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine bursts the skins,
the wine is poured out, and the skins are destroyed. Instead, new wine must be
put into fresh wineskins.”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Plucking grains on the Sabbath—The Lord of the Sabbath</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Now it happened that he was going on the
Sabbath day through the fields of grain; and his disciples, as they went, began
to pluck some heads of grain. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>The Pharisees asked Jesus,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn426" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref426"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[426]</span></span></span></a>
“Behold, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">25</sup>Jesus replied, “Have you never read what David
and those with him did, when he had need and was hungry? <sup class="calibre31">26</sup>How he
entered into the house of God (in the section about Abiathar<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn427" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref427"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[427]</span></span></span></a>

also gave it to those who were with him?” <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Jesus said to them, “The

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Again, Jesus entered into the synagogue, and there was a man
who had a withered hand. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>The Pharisees<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn431" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref431"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[431]</span></span></span></a>

to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day, so that they might accuse
him. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Jesus said to the man who had his hand withered, “Stand up!” <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>He
then said to those who were watching, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath
day, or [is it lawful] to do harm? Is it lawful to save a life or to kill?” But
they remained silent. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>After looking around at them with anger and
being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, Jesus said to the man, “Stretch
out your hand!” The man stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy
as the other. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>The Pharisees went out and immediately began to
conspire with the Herodians against Jesus,<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn433" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref433"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[433]</span></span></span></a>
[discussing] how they might get rid of him.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples,
and a great crowd followed him from Galilee, Judea, <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Jerusalem,
Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great
multitude of people, when they heard what great things Jesus was doing, came to
him.<sup class="calibre31"> 9</sup>Jesus instructed his disciples to have a little boat stay near
him because of the crowd, so that they would not press on him. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>For
he had healed many people, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him in
order to touch him. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him,
fell down before him and cried, “You are the Son of God!” <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>He

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">33</sup>When the sixth hour<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn595" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref595"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[595]</span></span></span></a>
came, there was darkness over the whole land<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn596" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref596"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[596]</span></span></span></a>
until the ninth hour.<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn597" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref597"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[597]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">34</sup>At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi,
Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted, “My God, my God, why have
you forsaken me?”<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn598" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref598"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[598]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">35</sup>Some of those who stood by, when they heard
this, exclaimed, “Behold, he is calling Elias (Elijah)!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">36</sup>One [of them] ran to fill a sponge with
vinegar. He put it on a reed and gave it to Jesus to drink. Then he said, “Let
us leave him alone and see if Elias (Elijah) will come to take him down.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">37</sup>But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and gave
up the spirit. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>The veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from the
top to the bottom. <sup class="calibre31">39</sup>When the centurion who stood there in front of
Jesus saw that he had cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly
this man was [the] Son of God!”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">40</sup>There were also women watching from afar, among
whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James ‘the little’<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn599" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref599"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[599]</span></span></span></a>
and of Joses, and Salome. <sup class="calibre31">41</sup>When Jesus was in Galilee, they had
followed him and served him; along with many other women who had come up with
him to Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">42</sup>Evening had now come. Because it was the
Preparation Day (the day before the Sabbath), <sup class="calibre31">43</sup>Joseph of Arimathea
(a prominent council member who was also looking for the Kingdom of God), came
forward. He boldly went in to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. <sup class="calibre31">44</sup>Pilate
wondered if Jesus was already dead. Calling the centurion, he asked him whether
Jesus had been dead for a long time. <sup class="calibre31">45</sup>Having been assured of this
by the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">46</sup>Accordingly, Joseph bought fine linen, took
Jesus down and wrapped him in the linen cloth. Having placed him in a tomb
which had been cut out of a rock, he rolled a stone against the door of the
tomb. <sup class="calibre31">47</sup>Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where
Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn600" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref600"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[600]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="msonormal1">When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother
of James, and Salome, bought spices in order to come and anoint him. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Very
early on the first day of the week, they arrived at the tomb when the sun had
risen. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the
stone from the door of the tomb for us?” <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>But when they looked up,
they saw that the stone was [already] rolled back, although it was extremely
large.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man
sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>He
said to them, “Do not be amazed! You seek Jesus the Nazarene, who has been
crucified. He has risen! He is not here! Behold, the place where they laid him!
<sup class="calibre31">7</sup>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into
Galilee. There you will see him, as he told you.’”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre67">8</span></sup><span class="calibre67">They went out<a title="" href="part0000_split_124.html#_edn601" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref601"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre77">[601]</span></span></span></a>
