<p class="msonormal1">The catholic Church is the fullness of the pre-eternal
Church of God manifested in space and time, an undivided whole lacking nothing
when it comes to the means of salvation. Thus, St. Ignatius could write to one local Church:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">To the Church which is at Ephesus, in Asia deservedly most happy, being blessed in the greatness and fullness of God
the Father, and predestinated before the beginning of time, that it should be
always for an enduring and unchangeable glory, being united and elected through
the true passion by the will of the Father, and Jesus Christ, our God…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2807" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2807"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2807]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is the theological and ontological identity of the
Church. But does it mean that this local Church, this “catholic Church,” has no structure beyond the local assembly, the deacons, the presbyters
and the bishop? How do Churches relate with one another? What about need for
leadership, even headship at every level: local, regional, national and
international?</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The first question is foundational: Does the Church have a
structure beyond the local assembly presided over by the bishop? Strictly
speaking, the answer can only be no. In the mind of the early Fathers, ‘there
is one bishop in the catholic Church’. Beyond that, we should speak of Churches
in Asia, Churches in Europe, Churches in the Empire, Churches everywhere. By
definition, the Eucharistic structure of the local Church cannot extend beyond
its boundaries.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2808" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2808"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2808]</span></span></span></a>
The local Church is the whole Church. What we see (and need) beyond the local
Church are structures of common union, communication and harmony. The main
point is that these structures do not belong to the Eucharistic ontology of the
catholic Church. Local Churches are in a relationship of individual wholeness
and mutual co-dependency. Further, the concept of layers of geographic
organization and communication comes from the very pages of the New Testament
(“the Churches in Achaia,” etc.) In this context, every Church is the same
catholic Church as every other, and their bishops have full ontological
equality. And yet, every gathering, even if it is a gathering of equals, should
have a leader or first for the sake of good order. In practice, various
criteria that can be used to facilitate order, such as age, years of service,
political importance of one’s Church or unique historical connection with an
apostle.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The 34<sup class="calibre31">th</sup> apostolic canon (already cited) can be
considered the golden rule for such forms of primacies at the service of these
geographic structures of communion:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">It is the duty of the bishops of every ethnic
area to know who among them is the <span class="calibre34">first</span>, and to recognize him as their <span class="calibre34">head</span>,
and to refrain from doing anything unnecessary without his advice and approval…
But let not [the primate] do anything without the advice and consent and
approval of all.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This canon can be understood as a practical application of
the words of our Lord to his Apostles:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">But Jesus called them together, and said, “You
know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and great ones make their
authority felt. It shall not be so among you! Instead, whoever desires to
become great among you shall be your servant. Whoever desires to be first (<i class="calibre4">protos</i>)
among you shall be your servant, even as the Son of Man came not to be served,
but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2809" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2809"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2809]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is a critical point. Primacy is essential in the
catholic Church defined as the local Eucharistic assembly. To be specific, the
primacy of the <i class="calibre4">protos-presbyteros</i> is connected with the conciliar nature
of the <i class="calibre4">presbyterium</i>. In other words, this primacy exists by divine
mandate because conciliarity also exists by divine mandate, even if the exact
prerogatives and powers of the <i class="calibre4">protos</i> are perhaps unclear.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Thus, as we go beyond the boundaries of the (local) catholic Church, order is also important, because conciliarity implies primacy. Yet, that
level of organization is of a different nature and the type of primacy that
exists there is both “analogous” and distinct. It is not an ontological
primacy, one that defines the very existence of the catholic Church and the
office of president of the Eucharist.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the catholic Church, a presbyter is elected to be the
permanent ‘head of the table,’ historically by the other presbyters and with
the assent of the people. There is indeed a special ordination or rather
consecration for the one who becomes bishop. When we consider a group of
Churches in a particular area, we have <i class="calibre4">a loosely analogous situation, but
not an identity of structure</i>. The Church (and bishop) that is first among
others is not needed for the Eucharist to be offered or for each Church to be
fully catholic. There is no consecration or ordination to the role of regional
primate; a particular bishop is recognized as the regional or indeed universal <i class="calibre4">protos</i>
when he becomes Eucharistic <i class="calibre4">protos</i> of the first Church, accepted as such
by the other Churches.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Primacy can exist in different ways at different levels of
organization. A husband is the head of his household in a unique sense that
reflects the ontology of the family. Every husband is equal in his primacy. A
village may have a leader or head who may hold his office by various means
(election, royal succession) and with specific powers. A club or association
will also have a president who holds ‘primacy’ among the members. What is clear
to all is that the primacy of the husband as head of his family has nothing to
do with those other forms of primacies. They are ontologically different and
pertain to different types of reality. Primacy in the family is a divine
reality, whereas primacy in the village or the club is normally created and
regulated by the members. Of course, “God is not a God of confusion,” which
means that every form of (legitimate) authority is in some sense divine.
However, the possibility to speak of a ‘divine primacy’ of the king, or the
judge, or indeed of a patriarch or pope can cause grave confusion. What is
essential is that the primacy of the husband or bishop exists by the divine
ontology of ‘family’ and ‘Church,’ not as options. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">It is in therefore in an organizational, not ontological
sense that Eastern Orthodoxy is comfortable with the idea of ‘primates’ and
‘heads’ and should indeed recognize the need for such leadership. Fr.
Meyendorff confirms:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">There exists, however, <span class="calibre34">another succession</span>,
equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only <span class="calibre34">on the level of the
analogy</span> existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college,
this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order.
Its limits are determined by the Councils, and—in the Byzantine practice—by the
“very pious emperors.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2810" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2810"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2810]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the authentically scriptural and patristic model, only
the local catholic Church (the diocese) has ontological existence. We do not ‘go
down’ (or sideways) from a worldwide organism to the local Church. Instead, we
see a network of Churches which has a different ontology than the catholic
Church. There is a top-down model, but it is that of the eschatological Church
intersecting with space and time, not that of the worldwide ‘Church.’ This is
how St. Ignatius<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2811" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2811"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2811]</span></span></span></a> can write that the bishop “is the place of God.”</p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418748"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418600"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267663">Imperial unity and Orthodox universalism</a></h3>

<p class="msonormal1">Christianity in general and Eastern Orthodoxy in particular
is undeniably connected with the history of the Roman Empire. After all, our
Lord was “crucified under Pontius Pilate”—a Roman imperial official. After
centuries of persecutions, a Roman emperor finally embraced the Christian faith
and embarked upon the difficult task of ‘harmonizing’ Church and State. Even
though Eucharistic ecclesiology was solidly embedded in the liturgy and
consciousness of the Church, the paramount concern became that of ecumenical
unity. Between Nicea (325) and Chalcedon (451), belief in the individual
wholeness of each catholic Church was maintained, but not emphasized. The main
concern was the political and ecclesiastical unity of ‘the catholic Churches’
as ‘one Catholic Church.’</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Within years, the ‘catholic Church’ became ‘the diocese’ and its boundaries were defined by the existing territorial subdivisions of
the imperial administration. This came to be known as ‘the principle of
accommodation.’ Within the confines of the Empire, it was essential to have
powerful ‘structures of communion’ to ensure the stability of the<i class="calibre4"> oecumene</i>.
Already, the Council of Nicea had ratified the regional primacies of Alexandria, Antioch and Rome. Within less than two hundred years, the catholic Churches
outside the boundary were severed from this worldwide communion by political
and theological factors. As a result of this process of separation and
restructuration, five patriarchates became responsible for the administration
of catholic Churches of the Empire.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Rome, of course, was the center of the universe, at least
until Constantinople—New Rome appeared on the scene between 325 and 381. For
the Emperor and the bishops of the <i class="calibre4">oecumene</i>, the known and civilized
world was the Empire. Universal ecclesiology was a matter of practical
administration, and Rome was the accepted center of authority. In the context
of the Empire, universal ecclesiology became the operative principle, even if
Eucharistic ecclesiology was still ontological and dogmatic. The primate of the
<i class="calibre4">oecumene</i> was the primate of his own regional patriarchate and “the head”
of all the Churches according to civil law. The realm of the five patriarchates
(‘the ecumenical Church’) became fully identified with the holy, catholic and apostolic Church. Thus, Charles Ajalat (Orthodox) notes that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">If the Roman Catholic Church was misled by universal ecclesiology, so in part was the Orthodox Church also misled. To be fair, the
Orthodox Church, beginning in the mid-[fourth] century (as a result of the
Roman Empire), has not implemented properly the early Church’s understanding of
there being one episcopate… Further, [the] Orthodox, whether it is consciously
admitted or not, often appear to see the Church as a number of isolated
Churches, generally along national borders (contrary to the historic
ecclesiology of the Church), one in faith and worship, but only a “part” of the
universal Church.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2812" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2812"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2812]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">A careful reassessment of the testimony of the early Fathers
shows us that Eucharistic ecclesiology and universal unity are not meant to be
contradictory and mutually exclusive. The great (pre-Nicene) expositors of
Eucharistic ecclesiology were also very concerned with the concord and unity of
the “common union.” They all recognized that, if possible, this common union
should be universal and that there should be a ‘first’ Church who would
“preside in love” with a ‘head’ bishop. Obviously, the Churches that were geographically
or in some other way out of reach could not participate in this structure. But
there was no doubt that worldwide harmony required a center of unity. On this
point, Orthodox and Roman Catholics agree. The key difference is the
ecclesiological model as well as the origin and type of primacy enjoyed by the
‘head’ bishop of the universal common union. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Roman Catholic theology of universal primacy is the
consequence and reflection of its universal ecclesiology.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">From the <i class="calibre4">Catechism of the Catholic</i><i class="calibre4"> Church</i>:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent"><b class="calibre7">The episcopal college and its head, the pope</b></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">880 When Christ instituted the Twelve, “he
constituted [them] in the form of a college or permanent assembly, at the head
of which he placed Peter, chosen from among them.” Just as “by the Lord’s
institution, St. Peter and the rest of the Apostles constitute a single
apostolic college, so in like fashion the Roman Pontiff, Peter’s successor, and
the bishops, the successors of the Apostles, are related with and united to one
another.”</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">882 The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter’s successor, “is the perpetual and visible source and foundation of the unity both of the
bishops and of the whole company of the Faithful.” “For the Roman Pontiff, by
reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as <span class="calibre34">pastor of the entire Church
has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church</span>, <span class="calibre34">a power</span>
which he can always exercise unhindered.”</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">883 “The college or body of bishops has no
authority unless united with the Roman Pontiff, Peter’s successor, as its
head.” As such, this college has “supreme and full authority over the universal
Church;<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2813" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2813"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2813]</span></span></span></a>
but this power cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman Pontiff.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2814" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2814"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2814]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">As we have seen, the ‘universal Church’ is a political or
functional arrangement, not an ontological reality. Contrary to the opinion of
some, the concept of universal primacy<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2815" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2815"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2815]</span></span></span></a>
does exist in the Orthodox Communion. It is not the historical primacy of Rome that is in question but rather its divine origin, absolute “fullness of power,”
ontological reality and unlimited scope. For the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the
documents of Vatican I (1870) described a universal <i class="calibre4">supremacy</i> of divine
right, not what should be properly called ‘primacy.’</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The <i class="calibre4">Encyclical of the Eastern (Orthodox) Patriarchs</i>
of 1848 made it clear that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">We (the Orthodox) see that very primacy, for
which his Holiness now contends with all his might, as did his predecessors,
transformed from a brotherly character and hierarchical privilege into a lordly
superiority.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Summarizing the Orthodox position, Timothy Ware<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2816" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2816"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2816]</span></span></span></a>
explains:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Orthodox believe that among the five patriarchs
a special place belongs to the pope. The Orthodox Church does not accept the
doctrine of Papal authority set forth in the decrees of the Vatican Council of
1870, and taught today in the Roman Catholic Church; but at the same time orthodoxy does not deny to the holy and apostolic See of Rome a primacy of honor, together with the right (under certain conditions) to hear
appeals from all parts of Christendom. Note that we have used the word
‘primacy,’ not ‘supremacy.’ Orthodox regard the pope as the bishop ‘who
presides in love,’ to adopt the phrase of St. Ignatius: Rome’s mistake—so
Orthodox believe—has been to turn this primacy or ‘presidency of love’ into a
supremacy of external power and jurisdiction… Let us ask in positive terms what
the nature of Papal primacy is from an Orthodox viewpoint. Surely we Orthodox
should be willing to assign to the pope, in a reunited Christendom, not just an
honorary seniority but an all-embracing apostolic care. We should be willing to
assign to him the right, not only to accept appeals from the whole Christian
world, but even to take the initiative in seeking ways of healing when crisis
and conflict arise anywhere among Christians. We envisage that on such
occasions the pope would act, not in isolation, but always in close cooperation
with his brother bishops. We would wish to see his ministry spelt in pastoral
rather than juridical terms. He would encourage rather than compel, consult
rather than coerce.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2817" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2817"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2817]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Setting aside the question of the universal primacy of Rome,
it is possible to examine the kind of primacy that Orthodox bishops consider
acceptable. Taking as an example the Orthodox Church of Russia (or more
accurately the Moscow Patriarchate), the official statutes read:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia shall
have <span class="calibre34">primacy in honor among the episcopate</span> of the Russian Orthodox
Church and shall be accountable to the Local and Bishops’ Councils.</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The relations between the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia and the Holy Synod shall be determined by Canon 34 of the Holy
Apostles and Canon 9 of the Council of Antioch in accordance with accepted
Orthodox tradition.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This patriarchal “primacy of honor” is much more than an
honorary rank. The reference to “Canon 34 of the Holy Apostles” is extremely important. This ancient canon reads:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">It is the duty of every nation to know the one
among them who is the first, and <span class="calibre34">to recognize him as their head</span>, and <span class="calibre34">to
refrain from doing anything unnecessary without his advice and approval</span>;
instead, each of them should do only whatever is necessitated by his own
district and by the territories under him. <span class="calibre34">But [the head] should not do
anything without the advice and consent and approval of all</span>. For only thus
there be concord, and will God be glorified through the Lord…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2818" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2818"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2818]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">“Canon 9 of Antioch” is an application of the same principle
to the prerogatives of the metropolitan:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The bishops of the province must know that the
bishop placed at the head of the metropolis [i.e. the metropolitan], is also
entrusted with the care of the province. It is to the metropolis that all those
go who have business to do. In consequence it has been ruled that he will
occupy the first place in regard to honors and that the other bishops (in conformity
with the ancient canon decreed by our fathers and which is still in force) will
not be able to do anything without him, except administer their diocese and the
territory adjoining. He must take care of the country districts which are
dependent on the episcopal city, ordain for them priests and deacons and do all
things with discernment. But, outside of these limits, he may do nothing
without the assent of the bishop of the metropolis who, in his turn, may decide
nothing without the advice of the other bishops.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the case of the ‘Russian Church,’ we find that the
patriarch’s primacy of honor comes with many ‘hierarchical privileges,’ namely:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">6. The Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, together with the Holy Synod shall convene Bishops’ Councils and in exceptional cases
the Local Councils and shall preside at them. The Patriarch of Moscow and All
Russia shall also convene the sessions of the Holy Synod. </p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">7. In exercising his canonical authority, the
Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia shall: a) be responsible for the
implementation of the decisions of the Councils and the Holy Synod; b) submit
to the Councils the reports on the situation in the Russian Orthodox Church for
the period between the Councils; c) uphold the unity of the hierarchy of the
Russian Orthodox Church; d) exercise authoritative supervision over all Synodal
departments; e) address the Pleroma of the Russian Orthodox Church with
pastoral messages; f) sign the general Church documents after their appropriate
approval by the Holy Synod; g) exercise the executive and instructive authority
in governing the Moscow Patriarchate; h) communicate with the Primates of the
Orthodox Churches in compliance with the decisions of the Councils or the Holy
Synod, as well as on his own behalf; i) represent the Russian Orthodox Church
in its relations with the highest bodies of the state authority and
administration; j) have the duty of petitioning and interceding before the
bodies of the state power both on the canonical territory and outside it; k)
approve the statutes of the Self-governing Churches, the Exarchates and the
Dioceses; l) receive the appeals from the diocesan bishops of the
Self-governing Churches; m) issue decrees on the election and appointment of
the diocesan bishops, the heads of the Synodal departments, the vicar bishops,
the rectors of the Theological schools and other officials appointed by the
Holy Synod; n) take care for the timely replacement of the episcopal sees; o)
entrust the bishops with temporal administration of the diocese in case the
diocesan bishops are ill for a long time, die or stand trial in the
ecclesiastical court; p) supervise the exercising by the bishops of their
archpastoral duty in taking care for the dioceses; q) have the right to visit
in necessary cases all dioceses of the Russian Orthodox Church (canon 34 of the
Holy Apostles; canon 9 of the Council of Antioch, Council of Carthage 52 (63);
r) give fraternal advice to the bishops pertaining both to their personal life
and the exercise of their archpastoral duty. In the event they do not heed to
his advice, he shall propose the Holy Synod to make an appropriate decision; s)
take to consideration the matters pertaining to the disagreements among the bishops,
who voluntarily ask for his mediation without formal legal proceedings. The
decision of the Patriarch in such cases shall be binding for both parties; t)
receive complaints concerning the bishops and set them in appropriate motion;
u) allow the bishops leave for more than 14 days; v) award the bishops with the
established titles and higher Church distinctions; w) award the clergy and
laity with Church awards; x) approve the awarding of scholarly degrees and
ranks; y) take care for the timely production and consecration of the holy
myrrh for general Church needs.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As we can see, a regional, national or universal primacy can
be endowed with practical and well-defined ‘hierarchical privileges.’ </p>

<p class="msonormal1">As a result, various forms of primacy do exist in the
context of Orthodoxy, both divine-ontological (bishop, husband) or functional
(metropolitan, patriarchs, pope until 1054). <i class="calibre4">The key here is the word
‘analogous.’</i> The functional primacies are ‘analogous’ to the ontological
primacy, but they are ultimately relative and man-made. This is why John
Meyendorff could conclude:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In the Orthodox perspective, Roman ecclesiology appears therefore to have weighed disproportionately the succession of the
Coryphaeus [Peter] in the person of the universal primate at the expense of the
succession of Peter in the person of the local bishop.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2819" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2819"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2819]</span></span></span></a></p>
