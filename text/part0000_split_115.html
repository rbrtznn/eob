<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span>Besides all the data from
patristic quotations and Greek MSS, there is also the evidence from the
lectionaries, books containing a long series of selections from Scripture to
read during church services. There are hundreds of lectionaries in existence,
and lectionary related rubrics appear in the margins of hundreds of
manuscripts. Mark 16:9-20 was (and remains to this day in Orthodox practice) a
reading selection for the Feast of Ascension, and it was the second of eleven
special selections called the Eothina, about the rising of Jesus. </span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><span>This further confirms the widespread
recognition of Mark 16:9-20 as a fully (albeit possibly non-Markan) received
ecclesiastical witness.</span></p>
