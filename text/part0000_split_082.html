CHURCH</a></h2>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418737"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418589"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267648">“One bishop in the catholic</a> Church”</h3>

<p class="msonormal1">Perhaps the most striking confirmation of Orthodox
Eucharistic ecclesiology and terminology comes from an early bishop of Rome: Cornelius (†252). Eusebius<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2753" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2753"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2753]</span></span></span></a>
has preserved for us the content of Cornelius’s letter to Fabian of Antioch:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[Referring to Novatian who attempted to seize
the bishopric at Rome] <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="43">This avenger of the Gospel then did not know
that <span class="calibre34">there should be one bishop in the catholic</span></a><span class="calibre34"> Church</span>;<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2754" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2754"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2754]</span></span></span></a>
yet he was not ignorant that in it there were forty-six presbyters, seven
deacons, seven sub-deacons, forty-two acolytes, fifty-two exorcists, readers,
and janitors, and over fifteen hundred widows and persons in distress…</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This early bishop of Rome confirms the holographic
ecclesiology of Ignatius: because the bishop is the living symbol of the unity
of the Church, “there should be one bishop in the catholic Church.” Clearly, Cornelius uses the expression ‘catholic Church’ to refer to the local Church without any doubt of being misunderstood.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Another early instance of the word catholic is associated
with St. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, who used the word many times. The <i class="calibre4">Martyrdom
of Polycarp</i>, written at the time of Polycarp’s death, reads:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The Church of God which sojourns in Smyrna, to
the Church of God which sojourns in Philomelium, and to all the dioceses of the
holy and Catholic Church in every place… When Polycarp had finished his prayer,
in which he remembered everyone with whom he had ever been acquainted … and
the whole Catholic Church throughout the world…</p>

<p class="msonormal1">These quotes, often poorly translated, are clear enough to
establish that ‘Catholic’ could not possibly mean ‘universal’ or ‘worldwide.’
If it were the case, ‘Catholic’ would mean “which is in every place” and this
leads to the conclusion that the <i class="calibre4">Martyrdom of Polycarp</i> would talk about ‘the [which is in every place] Church in every place,’ a meaningless tautology.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2755" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2755"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2755]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The evidence, then, is that there was no universal
ecclesiology in the second and third century.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2756" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2756"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2756]</span></span></span></a>
When the Western model appeared and developed, the result was to postulate only
one ultimate bishop (the pope) in the ‘catholic Church’ (the universal Church). </p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418738"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418590"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267649">St. Peter</a>, “head” of the catholic Church</h3>

<p class="msonormal1">Having a correct understanding of what the catholic Church is enables us to think with the mind of the Fathers on this issue, without
being affected by the so-called ‘Peter syndrome.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2757" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2757"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2757]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre67">We have already expressed
primitive Orthodox ecclesiology</span><span class="calibre67"> with this formula:</span></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent2"><b class="calibre7">INCARNATION &gt; EUCHARIST &lt;&gt; CATHOLIC CHURCH &gt; PETER &gt;
PRESIDENT-BISHOP = ESSENTIAL/ONTOLOGICAL/DIVINE ORDER</b></p>

<ol start="1" type="1" class="calibre124">
 <li class="msonormal23" value="1">The Incarnation implies the Eucharist</li>
 <li class="msonormal23" value="2">The Eucharist is connected with the Church in that both
     are “the Body of Christ” and “the Eucharist constitues the Church”</li>
 <li class="msonormal23" value="3">The Church’s celebration of the Eucharist requires a
     president, which is the Bishop</li>
</ol>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre67">By comparison, Roman
Catholic ecclesiology is explained in <i class="calibre4">Jesus, Peter</i></span><i class="calibre4"><span class="calibre67"> and the Keys</span></i><span class="calibre67"> whose introduction by Kenneth Howell offers the
universalist equivalent. In this model, the bishop is unavoidably absorbed by
the papacy:</span></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent3"><b class="calibre7">INCARNATION &gt;
CHURCH &gt; PAPACY<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2758" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2758"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2758]</span></b></span></span></a></b></p>

<ol start="1" type="1" class="calibre124">
 <li class="msonormal23" value="1"><span class="calibre67">The Incarnation implies
     a Universal Church as a worldwide organism</span></li>
 <li class="msonormal23" value="2">The worldwide church implies a worldwide bishop</li>
</ol>

<p class="msonormal1">The major difference resides in what we mean by Church. If
the Church is in fact a universal, worldwide organism or society, then the
Roman Catholic model makes sense. Orthodox scholar Alexander Schmemann was very lucid on this point:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">If the Church is a universal organism, she must
have at her head a universal bishop as the focus of her unity and the organ of
supreme power. The idea, popular in Orthodox apologetics, that the Church can
have no visible head because Christ is her invisible head is theological
nonsense. If applied consistently, it should also eliminate the necessity for
the visible head of each local Church, i.e. the bishop.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2759" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2759"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2759]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Of course, saying that the bishop is in some sense the
“head” of the (local) catholic Church (now called diocese) or that the
Patriarch of Moscow is the “head” of the Russian Orthodox Church (or more
accurately the Moscow Patriarchate) requires some clarification. This headship
is that of a representative or primate, according to the spirit of the 34<sup class="calibre31">th</sup>
apostolic canon which reads:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">It is the duty of the bishops of every ethnic
area to know who among them is <span class="calibre34">first</span>, and to recognize him as their <span class="calibre34">head</span>,
and to refrain from doing anything unnecessary without his advice and approval.
Instead, each [bishop] should do only whatever is necessitated by his own
district and by the territories under him. But let not [the primate] do
anything without the advice and consent and approval of all. For only thus
there be concord, and will God be glorified…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2760" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2760"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2760]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, such ‘headship’ cannot in any way be identified or
in competition with Christ’s ontological headship over the pre-eternal Church.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In summary, the New Testament and pre-Nicene use of
‘Church,’ ‘whole Church’ and ‘catholic Church’ assumes Eucharistic
ecclesiology. Moreover, the identity of etymology and concept between
‘catholic’ and ‘holographic’ is both illuminating and significant.</p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418739"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418591"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267650"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc126063928">The bishop as successor of St.
Peter</a></h3>

<p class="msonormal1">The role of a presiding-presbyter (later called bishop) as
successor of Peter who was <i class="calibre4">protos</i> among the Twelve is significant. This
is without doubt the patristic perspective.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">St. Ignatius is the first explicit advocate of what has come
to be called the ‘doctrine of the monarchical episcopate.’ However, Ignatius
does not make any connection between Peter and the bishop in a ‘successive’ or
symbolic sense. Origen, on the other hand, makes a clear identification between
the Petrine promises of Matthew 16 and the office of bishop. In fact, this
identification is not presented as a theological speculation: Origen tells his
readers that it was the standard claim of all bishops to have received the
power of the keys:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Consider how great power the rock has upon which
the Church is built by Christ, and how great power every one has who says, “Thou
art the Christ, the Son of the living God”… But when <span class="calibre34">those who maintain the
function of the episcopate make use of this word as Peter</span><span class="calibre34">, and, having received the keys of the kingdom of heaven from the Savior, teach that things bound by them</span>,
that is to say, condemned, are also bound in heaven, and that those which have
obtained remission by them are also loosed in heaven, we must say that they
speak wholesomely if they have the way of life on account of which it was said
to that Peter, “Thou art Peter…” But if he is tightly bound with the cords of
his sins, to no purpose does he bind and loose.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2761" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2761"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2761]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">It seems that Origen had traveled extensively by the time he
wrote his <i class="calibre4">Second Commentary on Matthew</i>. As a result, we must assume that
he accurately reported what he heard: bishops were quoting Matthew 16 to
establish the prerogatives of their office.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">With Cyprian, we have an unambiguous exposition of
Eucharistic ecclesiology combined with the identification Peter = Bishop. In the words of the great African bishop:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Our Lord, whose precepts and admonitions we
ought to observe, <span class="calibre34">describing the honor of a bishop and the order of His
Church</span>, speaks in the Gospel, and says to Peter: “I say unto thee that you
are Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church, etc.” And so, through the
changes of times and successions, the ordering of bishops and the plan of the
Church flow onwards, so that the Church is founded upon the bishops, and every
act of the Church is controlled by these same rulers… <span class="calibre34">The Church is
established in the bishop and the clergy</span>, and all who stand fast in the
Faith.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2762" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2762"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2762]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is not speculative theology—these are basic theological
arguments used by Cyprian to dissuade the lapsed from separating from their
bishop. The same Petrine arguments are expressed in his <i class="calibre4">Epistle to
Florentius</i>:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Peter answered Him: “You are the Son of the
living God.” <span class="calibre34">Peter speaks there, on whom the Church was to be built</span>,
teaching and showing in the name of the Church, that although a rebellious and
arrogant multitude of those who will not hear and obey may depart, yet the
Church does not depart from Christ; and they are the Church who are a people
united to the priest,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2763" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2763"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2763]</span></span></span></a>
and the flock which adheres to its pastor. And so, you should know <span class="calibre34">that the
bishop is in the Church, and the Church in the bishop. Anyone who is not with
the bishop is not in the Church</span>. Those flatter themselves in vain, not
having peace with God’s priests [bishops], think that they communicate ‘mysteriously’
with some; but the Church, which is catholic and one, is not cut nor divided. Indeed,
it is connected and bound together by the cement of [bishops] who bond with one
another.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is Eucharistic and episcopal ecclesiology <i class="calibre4">par excellence</i>. Yet, Cyprian is even more explicit in his famous <i class="calibre4">Treatise
on the unity of the catholic</i><i class="calibre4"> Church</i>. The source of unity of the catholic Church, he writes, is Peter, that is the episcopate:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">There is easy proof for faith in a short summary
of the truth. The Lord speaks to Peter, saying, “I say unto thee, that <span class="calibre34">you
are Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church</span>, and the gates of <i class="calibre4">Hades</i> shall not prevail against it. And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of
heaven; and whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven,
and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” And again
to the same He says, after His resurrection, “Feed my sheep.” And although to
all the Apostles, after His resurrection, He gives an equal power, and says,
“As the Father has sent me, even so send I you: Receive the Holy Spirit:
Whosesoever sins you remit, they shall be remitted; and whosesoever sins you
retain, they shall be retained; “yet, <span class="calibre34">that He might set forth unity, He
arranged by His authority the origin of that unity</span>, as beginning from one.
Assuredly the rest of the Apostles were also the same as was Peter, endowed
with a like partnership both of honor and power; but the beginning proceeds
from unity… Does he who does not hold this unity of the Church think that he
holds the Faith? Does he who strives against and resists the Church trust that
he is in the Church?</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The episcopate is one, the parts of which are
held together by the individual bishops. The Church is one which with increasing
fecundity extends far and wide into the multitude, just as the rays of the sun
are many but the light is one, and the branches of the tree are many but the
strength is one founded in its tenacious root, and, when many streams flow from
one source, although a multiplicity of waters seems to have been diffused from
the abundance of the overflowing supply nevertheless unity is preserved in
their origin.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2764" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2764"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2764]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The episcopate is the locus of unity of the catholic Church and every bishop sits on Peter’s chair. This text is often misunderstood and
misquoted by those who mistakenly think that Cyprian equates Peter’s Chair with the See of Rome. Cyprian clearly adopts a holographic model in which
every bishop is identical to the other because they are all expressions of the
one chair. There is no place for another layer of organization which would
create the sequence:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent3"><b class="calibre7">BISHOPS &gt; BISHOP
OF BISHOPS &gt; CATHOLIC CHURCH (UNIVERSAL ECCLESIOLOGY)</b></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Cyprian, along with his synod of North African bishops, left
no room for doubt:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">For neither does any of us set himself up as a
bishop of bishops, nor by tyrannical terror does any compel his colleague to
the necessity of obedience; since every bishop, according to the allowance of
his liberty and power, has his own proper right of judgment, and can no more be
judged by another than he himself can judge another.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2765" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2765"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2765]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Cyprian’s view of a Petrine succession in the episcopate is
the view of pre-Nicene Christianity and that of Byzantine/Orthodox theology. In
<i class="calibre4">The Primacy of Peter</i>, Fr. John Meyendorff writes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">On the other hand, a very clear patristic
tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine
of St Cyprian of Carthage on the “See of Peter” being present in every local
Church, and not only in Rome, is well known. It is also found in the East,
among people who certainly never read the De <i class="calibre4">unitate ecclesia</i> of
Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the
catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ “through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly
honors,” and the author of the Areopagitica, when speaking of the “hierarchs” of
the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of
ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium,
including such documents as the lives of the saints, would certainly show that <span class="calibre34">this
tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of
Christian ecclesiology</span><span class="calibre34"> to consider any local bishop to be</span> the
teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, <span class="calibre34">through apostolic
succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter</span>.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2766" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2766"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2766]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">As Fr. Meyendorff demonstrates both in <i class="calibre4">The Primacy of
Peter</i> and <i class="calibre4">Byzantine Theology</i>,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2767" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2767"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2767]</span></span></span></a>
this identification of Peter with the bishop continued well after the Great
Schism. In 1315, Patriarch John of Constantinople explained to the Emperor that he only accepted the episcopal office of the great capital after experiencing an
apparition of Christ who said “If you love me, Peter, feed my sheep.”
Meyendorff’s conclusion is especially significant:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Its is therefore comprehensible why, even after
the schism between East and West, Orthodox ecclesiastical writers were never
ashamed of praising the “coryphaeus,” and of recognizing his pre-eminent
function in the very foundation of the Church. They simply did not consider
this praise and recognition as relevant in any way to the Papal claims, since
any bishop, and not only the pope, derives his ministry from the ministry of
Peter.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2768" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2768"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2768]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Perhaps the most striking example of a bishop being called
“another Peter” is found in the writings of St. John Chrysostom, and this is significant because the great preacher had perhaps the most exalted
view of Peter to be found in patristic literature.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2769" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2769"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2769]</span></span></span></a>
We read:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In speaking of Peter, the recollection of <span class="calibre34">another
Peter</span> (St. Flavian of Antioch) has come to me, our common father and
teacher, <span class="calibre34">who has succeeded</span> to the virtue of Peter, and also to <span class="calibre34">his
chair</span>. For this is the one great prerogative of our city, that it received
the coryphaeus of the Apostles as its teacher in the beginning. For it was
right that she who first was adorned with the name of Christians before the
whole world, should receive the first of the Apostles as her pastor. But though
we received him as teacher, we did not retain him to the end, but gave him up
to Royal Rome. Nay, but we did retain him till the end; for we do not retain
the body of Peter but we retain the Faith of Peter as though it were Peter
himself; and while we retain the Faith of Peter, <span class="calibre34">we have Peter himself</span>.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2770" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2770"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2770]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Commenting on F.W. Puller’s <i class="calibre4">Primitive Saints and the See
of Rome</i>, Roman Catholic scholar Dom John Chapman writes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Father Puller’s quotation [from Chrysostom] begins after this point:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">“Why did He also pour forth His blood? To
purchase those sheep whom he committed <span class="calibre34">to Peter and his successors</span>.”</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Here Father Puller stops, remarking <span class="calibre34">correctly</span>
that <span class="calibre34">“his successors” does not mean the popes, but all bishops</span>.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This issue of a universal Petrine succession in all bishops
is extremely important and stands in sharp contrast with Roman Catholic
ecclesiology. For instance, James Likoudis expresses forcefully the common
Roman Catholic perspective:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">It is simply not true, and has never been, that
all Bishops <i class="calibre4">are equal by divine right as to their authority</i> and that our
Blessed Lord established <i class="calibre4">a visible Church without a visible head</i>.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2771" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2771"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2771]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">However, the Eastern Orthodox position, on the basis of
Eucharistic ecclesiology, is that the visible Church is the catholic Church and that it has a visible “head” (in a relative sense): the bishop.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2772" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2772"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2772]</span></span></span></a>
Moreover, if Peter’s successors are “all bishops,” to use Dom Chapman’s
admission, then all are indeed “equal by divine right as to their authority.”
As St. Jerome puts it:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Wherever there is a bishop, whether at Rome or Gubbio, or Constantinople or Rhegium, or Alexandria or Tanis, his worth is the
same, and his priesthood is the same. The power of riches or the lowliness of
poverty does not make him a higher or a lower bishop. But all are successors of
the Apostles.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2773" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2773"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2773]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Once this fundamental principle of divine and ontological
equality of all bishops is established, discussing the need for conciliarity
and primacy among the bishops is both possible and necessary. However, this
consideration implies another question. If all bishops are Peter‘s successors (Eucharistically speaking) and successors of particular Apostles (historically speaking), are not some bishops more ‘successors of Peter’ than
others? To answer this question accurately, a critical distinction must be made
between what the Fathers meant when they applied the Petrine texts to the
bishop and references to the historical pedigree of a particular Church. In the
Eucharistic sense, there can be no difference between two bishops, regardless
of their possible connection with the historical whereabouts of the Twelve.
Historically speaking, it might be said that a particular bishop is now
presiding over a community where Peter was once physically present. This is the
case of a number of cities, including Jerusalem, Antioch and Rome, but this had nothing to do with the divine structure of the Church, and indeed with the
Petrine office as understood by the Fathers. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">The ecclesiological question, then, becomes very specific:
Is there a particular “successor of Peter” who inherits Petrine primacy over
his fellow-bishops, indeed with ‘ordinary episcopal’ authority over them and
bishop of bishops? The Roman Catholic answer, expressed in the framework of
universal ecclesiology, is yes: the bishop who presides in the “the See of his
martyrdom.” In a document entitled <i class="calibre4">The Primacy of the Successors of Peter in
the Mystery of the Church</i>, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
(Pope Benedict XI was then Prefect as Cardinal Ratzinger), we have a classic presentation of the Roman Catholic ecclesiological model:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">From the beginning and with increasing clarity,
the Church has understood that, just as there is a succession of the Apostles in the ministry of Bishops, so too the ministry of unity entrusted to Peter belongs to the permanent structure of Christ’s Church and that <span class="calibre34">this succession

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, where the Orthodox would say “the ministry of unity
entrusted to Peter belongs to the permanent structure of Christ’s Church and
that this succession is established in every episcopal chair,” Roman Catholics
have a very different understanding of what is meant by “this succession.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This is the ecclesiological root of the current schism
between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy: two distinct understandings of
the concepts of ‘Church’ and ‘apostolic succession.’</p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418740"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418592"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267651">Peter</a>‘s special successors and Presbyteral Apostolic
Succession</h3>

<p class="msonormal1">Within the context of the nature of the Church, the
successors of Peter are the bishops. This view rests on solid biblical and
patristic foundations. From an historical or geographical perspective, every
bishop could be also considered as a successor of a particular apostle,
although without ontological meaning.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Moreover, a careful examination of both ecclesiologies
(universal and Eucharistic) implies two views of apostolic and Petrine
succession. If the successors of Peter are the bishops, does it not follow that
that the presbyters are successors of the Apostles? St. Irenaeus comes to mind:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">It is necessary to obey the presbyters who are
in the Church—those who, as I have shown, possess the succession from the
Apostles. For those presbyters, together with the succession of the bishops,
have received the certain gift of truth, according to the good pleasure of the
Father.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2775" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2775"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2775]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The same idea is also dramatically expressed by St. Ignatius:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The bishop presiding after the likeness of God
and the presbyters after the likeness of the council of the Apostles, with the deacons also who are most dear to me, having been entrusted with the
diaconate of Jesus Christ.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2776" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2776"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2776]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">In like manner let all men respect the deacons
as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the
Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles. Apart from these there is not even the name of a Church.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2777" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2777"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2777]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, in the very ancient <i class="calibre4">Constitutions of the Holy
Apostles</i>, we read:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Let the presbyters be esteemed by you to
represent the apostles, and let them be teachers of divine knowledge.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2778" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2778"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2778]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">It is important to realize that the Roman Catholic view is
somewhat different. In <i class="calibre4">Called to Communion</i>, Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) concluded his brief review of Orthodox Eucharistic ecclesiology with these words:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Orthodox theologians have contrasted the
Eucharistic ecclesiology of the East, which they hold up as the authentic model
of the Church, to the centralistic ecclesiology of Rome. In every local Church,
they maintain, the whole mystery of the Church is present when the Eucharist is
celebrated… Given this premise, the inference is drawn that the idea of a
Petrine office is contradictory…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2779" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2779"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2779]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">And yet, ‘the idea of Petrine office’ is very much at the
center of Orthodox ecclesiology. A major cause of disagreement and
misunderstanding is that Rome’s emphasis on Petrine succession is universal and
therefore ‘one level up.’ A few pages later, we read:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The second point follows from what has been
said: <span class="calibre34">the bishop is the successor of the Apostles,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2780" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2780"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre34"><span class="calibre28">[2780]</span></span></span></span></a>
but only the bishop of Rome</span><span class="calibre34"> is the successor of a particular apostle</span>—of
Saint Peter—and thus given responsibility for the whole Church.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2781" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2781"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2781]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">On the other hand, the Orthodox service for the reception of
converts asks:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Do you renounce the erroneous supposition that
the Holy Apostles did not receive from our Lord Jesus Christ equal spiritual
powers, but that the holy Apostle Peter was their Prince,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2782" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2782"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2782]</span></span></span></a>
and that the Bishop of Rome alone is his successor…<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2783" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2783"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2783]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Because the ideas connected to apostolic (and Petrine)
succession are assumed more than researched, few people are aware that the two
models are quite different, although to an extent complementary:</p>

<div class="calibre125">

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent4">EASTERN ORTHODOX:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent4">Church (catholic) &gt; Peter = Bishop &gt; Apostles = Presbyters</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent4">ROMAN CATHOLIC:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent4">Church (universal) &gt; Peter = Pope &gt; Apostles = Bishops</p>

</div>

<p class="msonormal1">Another issue is the possible application of Petrine
succession beyond its expression in the episcopate. The question is rather
simple. If we are trying to find a personal successor to the chief-apostle in the sense of a unique dynastic, universal and non-Eucharistic succession, what
are the credentials of particular bishops, including that of Rome? After all, Peter as ‘the first apostle’ ordained James as ‘the first bishop of the
first see’ (Jerusalem). Evodius, ‘first bishop of the city where the disciples
were first called Christians’ (Antioch), ordained by Peter long before Linus in
Rome also comes to mind. In that sense, the bishop of Rome would seem to be
last rather than first (<i class="calibre4">protos</i>). But of course, taken in account were
the importance of the city, the symbolic importance of having Peter’s relics
under the bishop’s altar and the fact that Peter (and Paul) would have
personally entrusted the Church of Rome to a ‘successor.’ Because proper
theology makes a sharp difference between the missionary ministry of the Twelve
and the local ministry of bishops, it is not surprising that the Orthodox later
complained that “You (Italians) have made him (Peter) who was teacher of the
world bishop of one city.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2784" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2784"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2784]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Indeed, if Petrine connections are to be considered as
paramount for universal primacy, four Churches can boast some kind of special
status: Jerusalem was the first choice in every way, as earthly Zion, altar of
Jesus Christ <i class="calibre4">par excellence</i>, and Mother-Church. Jerusalem is also the
See of the ‘Brother of the Lord’ who was ordained first bishop by Peter, James and John at the bidding of the Lord himself.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2785" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2785"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2785]</span></span></span></a>
But Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 and ‘deactivated’ until the 200s. Antioch was the second ‘Chair of Peter’ if one is to use this expression for a locale where
Peter personally proclaimed the Gospel. We have already encountered Chrysostom‘s conviction that Flavian of Antioch was “another Peter… who has succeeded to
the virtue of Peter, and also to his chair.” The third choice was Rome, because both Peter and Paul had honored the great city with their preaching and
the blood of their martyrdom. Of course, Rome—the capital and center of gravity
of the empire—had more than one reason to claim special status. The fourth
choice was Alexandria whose Church was known as “the See of St. Mark” and whose
bishops were first to be called “pope.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2786" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2786"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2786]</span></span></span></a>
Indeed, if anyone has a convincing case for being Peter’s special dynastic
successor, it is no other than the Evangelist Mark. Mark was an eyewitness of
the Lord, he was the companion and perhaps secretary of the great Apostle, even
writing “Peter’s Gospel” and significantly in a context of succession, Peter
calls him “my son.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2787" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2787"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2787]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Orthodox conviction is that the idea of Peter‘s personal dynastic succession is at odds with authentic ecclesiology which is rooted in Peter’s succession in the episcopacy. This does not mean that
the Pope is not successor of Peter in a certain sense (as indeed the Bishops of
Antioch or Alexandria). Likewise, there is meaning and beauty to the image of
St. Andrew as founder of the See of Constantinople. But ultimately, the
dynastic view cannot replace or even eclipse the traditional and theological
understanding that every bishop holds “the Chair of Peter.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, Rome’s historical primacy, which in some form is not denied
by the Orthodox, is a form of primacy that differs in nature from the Eucharistic
model.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Certainly, one Church should have a form of primacy (or
priority) among all the Churches because in every gathering there is some kind
of ‘first.’ When several Orthodox priests or bishops concelebrate Divine
Liturgy, there is an established way to determine a ranking, for the sake of
good order (typically years of ordination for priests and ecclesiastical titles
for bishops). In short, the essential equality of all bishops as successors of
Peter does not necessarily preclude an order of primacy and “hierarchical
privileges” among them, but in Eucharistic ecclesiology, it does exclude a truly episcopal, non-Eucharistic layer at the universal level.</p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418741"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418593"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267652">Demoted bishops and ordaining presbyters</a></h3>

<p class="msonormal1">The question of the relationship between bishop and
presbyter is quite important if we accept the idea that the episcopate
corresponds to the “Place of Peter” in the Church. It is important to reaffirm
that the structure of the (local) catholic Church (or diocese) cannot exactly be replicated outside its boundaries, i.e. to a ‘universal Church,’
because the ‘universal Church’ is not a Eucharistic assembly and therefore not
‘a Church.’ Rather, what is needed is a structure of communion and harmony
among the Churches. Still, if it can be proven that the bishop is ontologically
different than the presbyter and has supremacy over the local Church, it might
be tempting to replicate this structure to the so-called ‘universal Church’ and
consider both equally divine in origin. This, Orthodoxy contends, is the error
of Roman Catholic ecclesiology.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">With this in mind, it is significant to note that the early
Church did not see the office of bishop as something absolutely permanent. If,
for some reason, the proto-presbyter was no longer able to function as
Eucharistic head of the community, it was possible to ‘demote’ him to the rank
of layman or presbyter. For instance, Bishop Cornelius of Rome informed his colleague Fabian of Antioch that a certain bishop who had agreed to
consecrate the schismatic Novatian to the episcopate had been ‘readmitted as a
layman.’<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2788" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2788"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2788]</span></span></span></a>
A hundred years later, the Council of Nicea regulated the reception of former
“Cathars” (Novatians) as follows:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Accordingly, where all the ordained in villages
or cities have been found to be men of this kind alone, those who are so found
will remain in the clergy in the same rank; but when some come over in places
where there is a bishop or presbyter belonging to the catholic Church, it is evident that the bishop of the Church will hold the bishop’s dignity,
and that <span class="calibre34">the one given the title and name of bishop among the so-called
Cathars will have the rank of presbyter</span>, unless the bishop thinks fit to
let him share in the honor of the title. But if this does not meet with his
approval, the bishop will provide for him a place as <i class="calibre4">chorepiscopus</i> or
presbyter, so as to make his ordinary clerical status evident and <span class="calibre34">to prevent
having two bishops in the city</span>.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2789" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2789"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2789]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">It seems clear, however, that the roles and privileges of
presbyter and bishop are ultimately defined by one’s relationship with the
Eucharistic community. The consciousness of the Church could thus affirm the
essential importance of the bishop as necessary symbol of unity of the catholic Church while maintaining the understanding that the bishop also remains “a
fellow-presbyter.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2790" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2790"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2790]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418742"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418594"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267653">From “catholic</a> Church” to “Catholic Church”</h3>

<p class="msonormal1">Most pre-Nicene writers consistently use the expression
‘catholic Church’ to refer to the local episcopal assembly. This was the
normative usage, along with the plural ‘Churches.’ There were also instances
when ‘catholic Church’ could be used in a ‘generic’ sense, as in the expression
“the catholic Church everywhere.” In general, the context indicates that we are
not dealing with the local expression but with <span class="calibre34">a class</span>. Although it is
undeniable that this usage eventually developed into a ‘space-universal Church’
type of language, this was not the original intent. We could compare this usage
to such words as ‘fish’ or ‘deer’ which have an invariable plural form.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In a context where Eucharistic ecclesiology is assumed and understood, the expression ‘Catholic Church’<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2791" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2791"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2791]</span></span></span></a>
does not imply the existence of a universal Eucharist with a universal bishop.
It refers to a class or type of structure without reference to a particular
locale. Nevertheless, the temptation to shift from the class meaning to the
identity meaning is great and there is no doubt that the generic and convenient
expression ‘Catholic Church’ (or ‘Orthodox Church’) became a cause of
ecclesiological confusion, both East and West.</p>

<h3 class="calibre80"><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418743"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc425418595"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_Toc174267654">Roman Catholic</a> ecclesiology: who is fully catholic?</h3>

<p class="msonormal1">At this point, it is possible to fully understand the
divergence between the Roman Catholic understanding of ‘catholic’ and its Eastern Orthodox counterpart.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">In Roman Catholic ecclesiology, a local Church must be in
communion with the Church of Rome, indeed under the jurisdictional authority of
the bishop of that Church, to be fully catholic. The 1992 <i class="calibre4">Catechism of the
Catholic Church</i>, while influenced by Vatican II’s emphasis of some aspects
of Eucharistic ecclesiology, affirms that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent"> Particular Churches are fully catholic<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2792" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2792"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2792]</span></span></span></a>
through their communion with one of them, the Church of Rome “which presides in charity.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2793" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2793"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2793]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">In other words, “the Church of God which is at Ephesus” is not fully catholic apart from the Roman Church. Here, the local Church is
understood as the radiance and manifestation not of the eschatological Church
but of the worldwide organism centered in Rome. Hence, the <i class="calibre4">Catechism</i><i class="calibre4">
of the Catholic Church </i>teaches that:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The phrase “particular Church,” which is the
diocese (or eparchy), refers to a community of the Christian faithful in
communion of faith and sacraments with their bishop ordained in apostolic succession.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2794" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2794"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2794]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">These particular Churches “are <span class="calibre34">constituted
after the model of the universal Church</span>; it is in these and formed out of
them that the one and unique Catholic Church exists.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2795" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2795"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2795]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Orthodox theologians often notice the evolution of terms and
concepts associated with this ecclesiology. When the New Testament reads “whole
Church” and pre-Nicene Christians say “catholic Church,” the Catechism uses “particular Church(es).” Conversely, when the expression “Catholic Church” is used, it seems to refer to the universal Church, as in “it is in these
and formed out of them that the one and unique Catholic Church exists.” In the
same way, a <i class="calibre4">motus proprio</i> published by Pope John Paul II declares:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">He [the bishop] does not exercise the supreme
power which belongs to the Roman Pontiff and to the College of Bishops as
elements proper to the universal Church, elements present within each
particular Church, in order that it may <span class="calibre34">fully be Church, that is, a
particular presence of the universal Church</span> with all the essential elements
pertaining thereto.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This terminology can easily be a cause of confusion because
“universal Church” seems to be equated with “worldwide Church.” This lack of
distinction between the two has significant consequences.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Roman Catholic model: every “particular Church” must be
in communion, indeed subject to the Church of Rome and her bishop to be “fully
catholic.” </p>

<p class="msonormal1">What is conveyed is that the universal-worldwide Church

the local Church and that the local Church is a manifestation not of the
eschatological Church but of the so-called “universal Church.” As a result, the
local bishop becomes a manifestation of the universal bishop (the Pope) and his
authority is derived not from his own Petrine office (that is from Peter
directly and eschatologically) but from that of the Roman Pontiff. In the
framework of Vatican II, Pope Paul VI issued the decree <i class="calibre4">Dominus Christus</i>
which makes this point very clear:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">The order of bishops is the successor to the
college of the Apostles in teaching and pastoral direction, or rather, in the
episcopal order, the apostolic body continues without a break. Together with
its head, the Roman pontiff, and never without this head it exists as the
subject of supreme, plenary power over the universal Church. But this power
cannot be exercised except with the agreement of the Roman pontiff.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Pope Leo XIII had been even more explicit on the issue of
the bishop’s derived and conditional authority:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">From this it must be clearly understood that
bishops are deprived of the right and power of ruling, if they deliberately
secede from Peter and his successors; because, by this secession, they are
separated from the foundation on which the whole edifice must rest. They are
therefore outside the edifice itself; and for this very reason they are
separated from the fold, whose leader is the Chief Pastor; they are exiled from
that Kingdom, the keys of which were given by Christ to Peter alone… No one,
therefore, unless in communion with Peter can share in his authority, since it
is absurd to imagine that he who is outside can command in the Church.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2797" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2797"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2797]</span></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Clearly, we are dealing with two paradigms, two
terminologies and two ecclesiologies.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">For authentic Eastern Orthodoxy theology, the local Church
centered on the bishop is ‘the catholic Church’ and indeed the full
manifestation of the Body of Christ. That Church is a relational entity within,
and there lies its power to manifest the “whole Church.” At the same time, that
Church is in relation with other catholic Churches, not only for practical
reasons but also because neighboring bishops have to be involved for the
consecration of her bishop. This regional relationship gives rise to a form of
primacy that is functional, not Eucharistic. The <i class="calibre4">primus</i> or <i class="calibre4">protos </i>can
be the oldest, the most respected or typically the one who resides in the
regional capital. It will be whatever the Churches decide and accept. These
relationships can and should ideally develop into larger ‘structures of
communion’ which do not create a higher form of ‘Church’ (the universal
Church). According to this view, being in communion, or rather in obedience to
any other Church (e.g. the Church of Rome) has nothing to do with being ‘a
catholic Church.’</p>

<p class="msonormal1">For Roman Catholicism, the local Church is “a particular
Church” which seems to exist as a manifestation of the universal (worldwide)
Church. As a result, the local Church can only be considered ‘catholic’ if it is indeed a member, <span class="calibre34">part</span> or <span class="calibre34">portion</span> of the universal Church,
i.e. in communion with Rome. In this model, the universal Church is not so much
a “network” as a “star”—with the Church of Rome at the center and the other
particular Churches like ‘spokes of a wheel.’ In the end, the identification of
‘Catholic Church’ with ‘universal Church’ leads to the conclusion that there
must indeed be “one bishop in the catholic Church,” as St. Cornelius wrote so forcefully. But this is applied to the idea that there should be one
universal bishop in the (universal) catholic Church since it is the pattern and
the model that precedes the local Church. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">In Eastern Orthodoxy, the liturgical life of the Church is
the expression of its beliefs; indeed, it constitutes its very being. In fact,
a closer look at the great Eastern liturgies will help us address the very
question of ecclesiology. If we ask the question: “what precedes the
Eucharistic worship of the (local) catholic Church? Is it the space-universal Church (on earth) or the space-time eschatological Church? The answer
of the liturgy seems quite clear. The Eucharistic event which manifests the
Body and Blood of Christ (and thus the Church) is a manifestation of the
pre-eternal <i class="calibre4">eschaton</i>. The entrance with the Gospel (and indeed the
entire spirit of Eastern worship) is reminiscent of Hebrews 12:18-29:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">As it is, you have not come to a mountain that
can be touched; not one that burned with fire, gloom, darkness, storm… Instead,
you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels, to the assembly of the firstborn
who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of the
righteous made perfect, to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood
of sprinkling which pleads better than Abel’s…</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Therefore, since we are receiving a Kingdom that
cannot be shaken, let us be grateful and so offer divine service to God
acceptably, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire. (EOB)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As the liturgy ascends and transcends time and space, the
priest prays:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent"> O Master Lord our God, You have appointed in
heaven the orders and hosts of angels and archangels to serve Your glory; grant
that the holy angels may enter with us to serve and glorify Your goodness with
us. For to You belong all glory, honor, and worship; to the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen. (The priest
blesses the entrance saying in a low voice:) Blessed is the entrance of Your
saints always, now and forever and to the ages of ages! Amen.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2798" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2798"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2798]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">In the context of Hebrews 12, it might be argued that the
catholic Church is an approach to the triumphant Church rather than a
manifestation of the eschatological Church. The answer is that it encompasses
both. The rest of the Liturgy leaves no doubt what it is that the catholic
Church manifests:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent"><span class="calibre34">Remembering</span>, therefore, this command of
the Savior, and all that <span class="calibre34">has come to pass</span> for our sake, the cross, the
tomb, the resurrection on the third day, the ascension into heaven, the
enthronement at the right hand of the Father, <span class="calibre34">and the second, glorious
coming</span>, We offer to You these gifts from Your own gifts in all and for all.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">These texts convey the idea that the Eucharistic liturgy of
the Eastern tradition does not aim at manifesting the preceding reality of the
worldwide universal Church into a particular city.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Instead, the local Church can be compared to a pinhole that
lets the eternal light of God’s fulfilled plan of salvation shine into our
world. This is why the ancient Eastern liturgies are not cultural expressions,
and there can be no such thing as a ‘Jazz’ or ‘Rock’ Divine Liturgy.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Eastern Christian worship is about a community ascending in
the Spirit to face the throne of God as one. The bishop’s altar is a point of
contact with “the ideal altar;” it is indeed, the same altar, the same throne,
the same eternal sacrifice.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">To an extent, contemporary Roman Catholic worship can be understood as the logical consequences of universal ecclesiology. Centered on the local and universal community, it tends to reflect its values,
artistic talents and diversity. </p>

<p class="msonormal1">Before moving ‘one layer up’ to regional and universal
structures of communion, it is important to understand how the ‘catholic Church’ (the episcopal assembly or diocese) relates to the modern parish.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2799" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2799"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2799]</span></span></span></a>
A non-Orthodox critique of Eucharistic ecclesiology explains what seems to be its “fatal flaw:”</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">There is another flaw in Eucharistic
ecclesiology. Its advocates assure us that the fullness of Christ is to be
found in each local Church (diocese), not in some abstraction called “universal
Church.” The local Church cannot be simply “part” of the “Church”—it is “the
Church” because Christ’s body cannot be divided. Now appears the flaw. What is
the relation of each parish to the local Church? <span class="calibre34">If each local Church cannot
be part of a universal Church, how can each parish be part of a diocese? After
all, the parish itself, not the diocese, is the Eucharistic community…</span> This
is a crucial point because, as Schmemann in effect admits, Eucharistic
ecclesiology goes down the tube if it cannot satisfactorily relate the parish
to the diocese in its scheme of things. [The] inability of Eucharistic
ecclesiology to relate the individual parish to its diocese is a fatal flaw.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2800" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2800"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2800]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Indeed, the modern parish is how people experience the
Eucharistic community. The relationship between the parish (led by the
presbyter) and the ‘catholic Church’ (led by the bishop) has been studied in
depth by Metropolitan John (Zizioulas) of Pergamon. Suffice it to say that in
Orthodox Eucharistic ecclesiology, the parish is not a ‘catholic Church.’ It
is, as in the early Church, an extended part of the episcopal Eucharist. The
presbyter has been detached in space to extend the one altar as needed, but it
is not a separate Eucharist. Zizioulas has shown that the early Churches opted
for such a spatial distribution of the <i class="calibre4">synthronon<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2801" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2801"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2801]</span></b></span></span></a></i>
because its ecclesiology was solidly established, and because great care was
made to connect the presbyter-led parish with its bishop, by means of the <i class="calibre4">fermentum</i>,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2802" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2802"><span class="msoendnotereference"><i class="calibre4"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2802]</span></b></span></i></span></a>
the <i class="calibre4">antimension</i>,<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2803" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2803"><span class="msoendnotereference"><i class="calibre4"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[2803]</span></b></span></i></span></a>
the commemoration of the bishop, etc.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">It may seem that “the parish, not the diocese, is the
Eucharistic community,” but in fact, the parish is an extension, a part of the
full community gathered around the bishop. This is why the presbyter
commemorates his bishop<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2804" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2804"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2804]</span></span></span></a>
and offers the Eucharist on the bishop’s <i class="calibre4">antimension</i>.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2805" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2805"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2805]</span></span></span></a>
This is how the parish is a part or fraction of the diocese—so that the
holographic pattern of the catholic Church can be complete
(bishop—presbyters—deacons). It does not follow from this organization that the
diocese is properly speaking a part of a ‘universal Church:’ it is the ‘whole
Church,’ the ‘catholic Church,’ in keeping the principles discussed previously.<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2806" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2806"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2806]</span></span></span></a></p>
