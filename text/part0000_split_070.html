<p class="msonormal1">Unlike most annotated versions, the EOB footnotes lean
toward the view that Babylon the Great is in fact apostate Jerusalem, not Rome.
One reason for the traditional identification <a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="OLE_LINK10"></a><a class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="OLE_LINK9">of Babylon with Rome</a> may be the adoption of a post-70 date
for Revelation’s redaction together with the influence of Tertullian and
Irenaeus. Irenaeus does not give an explicit identification but his disciple
Hippolytus certainly did.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">On the other hand, there is substantial Scriptural data that
points to the identification of Babylon with Jerusalem, and this view has been
supported by a large number of scholars and commentators, from Scott Hahn to
Margaret Barker.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Among the elements being considered is the fact that in
Revelation 11:8, the “great city” is the place where the Lord was crucified,
i.e. Jerusalem. The same expression is applied to Babylon in 17:18 and
throughout chapter 18. In 18:24, the description “in her was found the blood of
prophets and of saints” applies much better to Jerusalem than to Rome, echoing Luke
13:34.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">It should also be noted that Babylon “rules over the kings
of the earth,” an expression which seems to fulfill Deuteronomy 15:6; “you
shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; you shall reign over many
nations, but they shall not reign over you.” Considering the importance of
economic themes throughout the Scriptures including Revelation (Jubilees, loans),
it is interesting to note that the Hebrew word for “interest” is Nashak which
has the following entry in a typical lexicon:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Mark = mark left by the bite of a snake (Nashak
(h5391) naw-shak’; a prim. root; to strike with a sting (as a serpent); fig.,
to oppress with interest on a loan).</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Finally, Revelation is consistent with the Johannine
contrast between the true Jews (or Israelites) and the false Jews who claim
that “they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2410" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2410"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2410]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="msonormal1">Hence, the contrast between the fallen earthly Jerusalem and
heavenly Zion is best explained by an opposition between the city where the
Lord was crucified and the true and heavenly Zion who is Mother of the Living.</p>
