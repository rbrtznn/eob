<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ [appointed]
to bring God’s elect to faith and to the knowledge of the truth which leads to
godliness, <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>and also to the hope of eternal life, which God (who
cannot lie) promised before the age began. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>In his own time, he
revealed his word in the message I was entrusted with according to the
commandment of God our Savior. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>To Titus, my true child according to
the faith which we share: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Titus’ commission in Crete—Requirement for Church offices</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>I left you in Crete for this reason: that you
would set in order the things that were amiss<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2098" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2098"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2098]</span></span></span></a>
and appoint presbyters<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2099" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2099"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2099]</span></span></span></a>
in every city, as I directed you: <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>someone who is blameless, the
husband of one wife, whose children believe and are not accused of loose or
unruly behavior. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Indeed, the overseer must be beyond reproach, as
God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not someone who abuses
wine, not violent and not greedy for dishonest gain. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Instead, he
should be hospitable, a lover of what is good, sensible, just, holy and
self-controlled; <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>holding fast to the sure word which is in harmony
with what has been taught, so that he may be able both to exhort in the sound
doctrine and to refute those who contradict.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>There are also many who are rebellious,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2100" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2100"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2100]</span></span></span></a>
vain talkers, and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>whose
mouths must be stopped. These men upset entire families, teaching things they
should not [teach], doing it for sordid gain. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>One of them, one of
their own prophets, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy
gluttons.” <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>This testimony is true! For this reason, rebuke them
sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>not paying
attention to Jewish fables and human commandments which distract<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2101" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2101"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2101]</span></span></span></a>
from the truth. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who
are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their
conscience are defiled. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>They profess to know God, but by their
works they deny him, being detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good
work.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">What Titus should teach</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Proclaim what is consistent with sound doctrine: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>that
older men should be temperate, sensible, sober-minded, sound in faith, love and
patience. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Likewise, older women should be reverent in behavior, not
malicious gossips, nor enslaved to much wine, but teachers of what is good. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>They
should instruct the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
<sup class="calibre31">5</sup>to be sober-minded, chaste, homemakers, [and to be] kind. Young
women should be in subjection to their own husbands, so that God’s word may not
be disgraced. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober-minded. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Be
an example of good works in all things. In your teaching, be a model of<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2102" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2102"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2102]</span></span></span></a>
integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>and soundness of speech
that is beyond reproach. This way, those who oppose you will be ashamed, having
nothing bad to say about us. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Exhort slaves to be in subjection to
their own masters and well-pleasing in all things, not argumentative, <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>not
stealing, but [instead] trustworthy, so that they may make the doctrine of God
our Savior attractive in every way. <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Truly, the grace of God has
appeared, bringing salvation to all. <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>It has taught us that we
should deny what is ungodly and worldly lusts, that we should live soberly,
righteously, and in a godly way in this present world, <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>waiting for
the blessed hope: the appearing<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2103" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2103"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2103]</span></span></span></a>
of the glory of our great God and Savior<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2104" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2104"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2104]</span></span></span></a>
Jesus Christ. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>He gave himself for us in order to redeem us from
all iniquity and to purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous
for good works. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Teach these things, exhort and reprove with
complete authority. Let no one despise you!                              </p>

<p class="style345ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Remind the people to be submissive to rulers and authorities,
to be obedient and ready for every good work, <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>not speaking evil of
anyone and not contentious. They should also be gentle, showing great humility
toward everyone. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Indeed, we used to be foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy,
hateful, and hating one another. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>But when the kindness of God our
Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>(not by works of
righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy), he saved us
through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Yes,
God richly poured out this Spirit on us, through Jesus Christ our Savior, <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>so
that being justified by his grace, we become heirs according to the hope of
eternal life. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>This saying is sure. Concerning these things, I
desire that you teach with confidence, so that those who have believed God may
be careful to persevere in good works. These things are good and profitable to
all. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>Avoid foolish questions, genealogies, dissensions, and
disputes about the law. These things are unprofitable and vain. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>After
a first and second admonition, have nothing more to do with anyone who causes
divisions,<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2105" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2105"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2105]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">11</sup>knowing that such a person is perverted, sinful and
self-condemned.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Practical instructions and conclusion</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, do
your utmost to meet me at Nicopolis, for I have determined to spend the winter
there. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily
and see that they lack nothing. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Make sure that our people also
learn to maintain good works to meet urgent needs, so that they may not be
unfruitful.<a title="" href="part0000_split_126.html#_edn2106" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2106"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2106]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>All who are with me greet you! Greet those who
love us in faith. Grace be with you all! Amen.</p>
