<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">We now turn to the external evidence. Over 1,500 Greek
copies of the Gospel of Mark exist. Only two of those MSS end the Gospel of
Mark at 16:8 followed by the closing book-title. In all other intact copies,
Mark 16:9-20 is included in the Gospel of Mark. The earliest existing copy,
Papyrus 45 (from around 225 AD), is extensively damaged, and it has no text at
all from chapter 16, so there is no way to know if P45, when it was produced,
contained 16:9-20 or not.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Five Greek MSS have a short paragraph called the Shorter
Ending after 16:8, and another one has the Shorter Ending in the margin, linked
to the end of 16:8 by asterisks. But all six of these also present (or
presented when produced, before undergoing damage) 16:9-20.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">This being said, the two Greek MSS that end the Gospel of
Mark at the end of 16:8 are very important: Codex Vaticanus (from c. 330) and
Codex Sinaiticus (from c. 350). They are the oldest and second-oldest existing
copies of Mark 16. These two ancient codices were the primary basis for a
revision of the Greek text of the New Testament that was published in 1881, and
which is the direct ancestor, so to speak, of the Critical Text (CT) upon which
most modern translations are based. Fenton Hort, one of the revisors, valued
the testimony of these two MSS so highly that he wrote that when they agree,
their readings should be accepted, with a few exceptions, “until strong
internal evidence is found to the contrary.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">However, we cannot overlook that both Codex Vaticanus and
Codex Sinaiticus have unusual features at the end of Mark that lessen their
usual weight in this matter. Details are very important in this case. The
copyist of Codex Vaticanus arranged the text of the New Testament in three
columns on each page. Throughout the New Testament, whenever the end of a book
was reached, the copyist began the next book at the top of the very next column
– except at the end of Mark. After Mark 16:8, the copyist left the next column
entirely blank, and began the Gospel of Luke at the top of the other side of
the page. This sort of deliberate insertion of blank space happens nowhere else
in Codex Vaticanus. It is as if the copyist, though using a master-copy that
ended with 16:8, had read 16:9-20 in another MS, and attempted to reserve space
where it could be inserted, if the eventual owner of the codex wished to do so.
His estimate of the space needed to contain 16:9-20 was off by four lines, but
if a copyist were to slightly shrink his lettering and begin to write 16:9 immediately
after 16:8, he could fit 16:9-20 into the blank space. Thus Codex Vaticanus,
while supporting the ending at 16:8, also suggests the existence of an equally
ancient MS, recollected by the copyist, that contained 16:9-20.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">In Codex Sinaiticus, there is an unusual feature of a
different sort at the end of Mark. All four pages that contain Mark 14:54 -
Luke 1:56 (formatted in four columns per page, for a total of 16 columns on
these four pages) are not the pages made by the main copyist who produced the
surrounding pages. They are replacement pages, the work of a different copyist,
perhaps a supervisor who was in charge of proof-reading the MS before it was
sewn together. It seems that something in the pages produced by the main
copyist led this other copyist to completely remove them, rewrite all four
pages using another parchment-sheet (folded in the middle so as to form four
pages) and insert them as replacement. One can only speculate on the reason for
this rather drastic step. Rather than build upon theories about the contents of
the replaced pages, we should focus on three features of the replacement pages.
First, after 16:8, there is a uniquely emphatic decorative design. It is as if
the copyist wanted to convey that nothing further should be added. Second, the
copyist who made the replacement pages worked rather carelessly; apparently he
wrote the text of Luke 1:1-56 first, beginning at the top of the eleventh
column of the 16-column sheet, and then wrote the text of Mark 14:54-16:8, but
he accidentally skipped most of 16:1. To avoid leaving the tenth column blank,
he had to drastically stretch the lettering of 16:2-8. </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Third, the handwriting, spelling, space-filling symbol, and
decoration-design of the copyist who produced these replacement pages in Codex
Sinaiticus are the same as the handwriting, spelling, space-filling symbol, and
decoration-design of one of the copyists who made Codex Vaticanus. Not only
does this indicate that both of these MSS were produced at the same place, but
it narrows the scope of their testimony because at this particular point, we do
not seem to be observing two independent MSS.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Meanwhile, other ancient MSS, including Codex Alexandrinus,
Codex Bezae, and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, support the inclusion of Mark
16:9-20. These MSS are not quite as old as Codex Vaticanus and Codex
Sinaiticus, but they are still quite ancient and represent a wide range of
testimony. Hence, footnotes claiming that Mark 16:9-20 is ‘contained only in
later manuscripts’ would be misleading.</p>
