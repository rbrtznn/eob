<p class="msonormal1">Ignatius of Antioch was a man who was close in spirit and
times to the Apostles. Whenever Ignatius uses the term “bishop,” he always
applies it to the leading, one-man shepherd of a ‘city-Church’ or “catholic Church.”
Ignatius did not use the term “bishop” as the New Testament does, that is
interchangeably with “presbyter.” Rather, for Ignatius, “bishop” and
“presbyter” are clearly separate offices. On several occasions, Ignatius refers
to the traditional three-fold ministry of “bishop/presbyter/deacon,” in which
the term “bishop” (“overseer”) is used for the monarchical proto-presbyter
alone:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">You must all follow the bishop as Jesus Christ
follows the Father, and the presbyters as you would the Apostles. Reverence the
deacons as you would the command of God. Let no one do anything of concern to
the Church without the bishop. Let that be considered an assured<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2701" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2701"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2701]</span></span></span></a>
Eucharist which is celebrated by the bishop, or by one whom he appoints.
Wherever the bishop appears, let the people be there; just as wherever Jesus
Christ is, there is the catholic Church. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Smyrneans</i>)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Your most worthy bishop, and through your worthy
presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon
Soto, whose friendship may I ever enjoy, inasmuch as he is subject to the
bishop as to the grace of God. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Magnesians</i>,
Chapter II)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Do not err, my brethren: if anyone follows a
schismatic, he will not inherit the Kingdom of God… Take care, then, to use one
Eucharist, so that whatever you do, you do according to God: for there is one
Flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one Cup in the union of His Blood; one
altar, as there is one bishop with the presbyters and my fellow-servants, the
deacons. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Philadelphians</i>, 3:2-4:1)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Furthermore, in spite of occasional assertions that St.
Ignatius of Antioch was the ‘creator’ or first proponent of the monarchical
episcopate, the fact is that the great Father spoke of these bishops as
already-existing in each of the Asian city-Churches he writes to. Indeed, he
even addresses all but one of these bishops by name:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">I received therefore your whole multitude in the
name of God, through Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love, and your bishop in
the flesh, whom I pray you by Jesus Christ to love, and that you would all seek
to be like him. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i>, Chapter I)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">I know that you possess a blameless and sincere
mind in patience, and that not only in present practice, but according to
inherent nature, as Polybius your bishop has shown me. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i>
<i class="calibre4">Trallians</i>, Chapter I)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">I salute your most worthy bishop Polycarp, and
your venerable presbyters, and your Christ-bearing deacons, my
fellow-servants… (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Smyrneans</i>, Chapter
XI)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Since, then, I have the privilege of seeing you,
through Damas your most worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus
and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon Soto, whose friendship
may I ever enjoy, inasmuch as he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of
God. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Magnesians</i>, Chapter II)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the
Church of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, which is at Philadelphia,
in Asia… which I salute in the blood of Jesus Christ, who is our eternal and
enduring joy, especially if men are in unity with the bishop, the presbyters,
and the deacons, who have been appointed according to the mind of Jesus Christ,
whom He has established in security, after His own will, and by His Holy
Spirit. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Philadelphians</i>, Introduction and
Chapter I)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Besides, Ignatius repeatedly refers to himself as either the
“bishop of Antioch” or the “bishop of Syria,” meaning that he himself was the
monarchical shepherd of the enormous first century Church of Antioch (capital
of Syria). For example, he says:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Remember in your prayers the Church of Syria
(Antioch), which now has God for its bishop instead of me. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i>
<i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Romans</i>, Conclusion)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">To summarize: at the time of Ignatius, about a decade after
the death of the last Apostle, we find a pre-existing situation in which the
following persons are already ruling as bishops over the following
(corresponding) Churches:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Ignatius = Bishop of Antioch</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Onesimus = Bishop of Ephesus</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Polycarp = Bishop of Smyrna (a disciple of the
Apostle John)</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Damas = Bishop of Magnesia</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Polybius = Bishop of Tralles</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">[Unnamed] = Bishop of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">At the very end of the apostolic age, we have six separate
Churches<a title="" href="part0000_split_127.html#_edn2702" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref2702"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[2702]</span></span></span></a>
being governed by monarchical bishops. Furthermore, Ignatius of Antioch had
never visited any of these other Churches before. Yet, they all possessed
monarchical bishops before he reached them on his way to Rome.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">With this fact in mind, one cannot help but ask the
question: Who appointed all these monarchical bishops, especially in places
such as Ephesus, Smyrna, and Philadelphia, over which the Apostle John himself
had so recently wielded authority (and over the very same still-living
Christians who Ignatius addresses in his epistles)? The most likely and
sensible conclusion is that St. John himself had appointed these bishops to be
the leading shepherds of the Asian city-Churches in his absence. Who then had
appointed Ignatius as monarchical bishop of far-off Antioch? Given that Antioch
was also clearly an apostolic ‘city-Church,’ it seems obvious that another
Apostle had appointed his first predecessor to the office of monarchical bishop
as well. Hence (as we shall confirm from Scripture itself below) the office of
monarchical bishop was established by the Apostles themselves, and was not some
later development as some theologians believe.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This may be well-established for Eastern city-Churches like
Antioch and those in Asia, but what about Western Churches? Many have wondered
about the fact that Ignatius does not address a “bishop of Rome” or speak to
the Romans as he does to the other (Asian) Churches he writes to, telling them
to remain faithful to their bishops, etc. Yet, we should not conclude that the
situation was different in Rome (or in the West), and that Rome was ruled by a
‘college of co-equal presbyters.’</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Ignatius addresses neither a “bishop of Rome” nor a “college
of presbyters.” Actually, he never addresses any presiding authority for the
Roman Church, perhaps because of a vacancy in the episcopate or in order to
protect the bishop in circumstances of intense persecution. However, Ignatius
does refer to himself as a monarchical bishop when addressing the Romans, which
in itself shows that it was an acceptable and understandable idea. He writes:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Remember in your prayers the Church of Syria
(Antioch), which now has God for its bishop instead of me. (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to the
Romans</i>, Conclusion)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Moreover, in chapter III of his <i class="calibre4">Epistle</i> <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i>
<i class="calibre4">Ephesians</i>, St. Ignatius clearly says:</p>

<p class="bibleq">“And also bishops, settled everywhere, to the utmost bounds of
the earth, are so by the will of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Here, once again, we must remember that, for Ignatius, “bishop”
was a term that exclusively referred to the leading presbyter of a city-Church.
Thus, if “bishops” were “settled everywhere, to the utmost bounds of the earth”
in Ignatius’ day, we can conclude that there was a bishop of Rome as well.
Those who wish to deny this point, or maintain that Ignatius only recognized a
‘college of equal presbyters’ governing the Church of Rome, must explain this
direct statement by Ignatius.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Furthermore, aside from the contextual reasons why Ignatius
does not mention a bishop for Rome, it is likely that there were also semantic
ones. Given the fact (as the New Testament illustrates) that the earliest
Christians used the terms “bishop” and “presbyter” interchangeably and assuming
that the Ignatian terminology (in which “bishop” is used exclusively for the
monarchical leader of a city-Church) probably developed first in the East, it
would therefore serve to reason that, at the time of Ignatius, the West was
still using the original (interchangeable) New Testament terminology, as
opposed to the newer (Ignatian) terminology. Clear evidence is found in the
case of Ignatius’ associate St. Polycarp of Smyrna, one of the monarchical
bishops whom Ignatius met (and later writes to) during his overland journey to
Rome. Indeed, Polycarp is unquestionably the monarchical bishop of the Church
of Smyrna:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">I salute your most worthy bishop Polycarp, and
your venerable presbyters, and your Christ-bearing deacons, my
fellow-servants… (Ignatius, <i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Smyrneans</i>, Chapter
XI)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">Ignatius speaks of Polycarp as a monarchical bishop on
several occasions in the two separate epistles he sent him (i.e., “Ignatius to
the Smyrneans” and “Ignatius to Polycarp”). Yet, in the months that follow, as
Polycarp corresponds with the Western (European) city-Church of Philippi (in
Macedonia), first to check on Ignatius’ welfare and then to give them
encouragement and advice, we notice a very significant change in semantics. In
an Asian context, Polycarp is directly called “the bishop” of Smyrna, but when
addressing the (Western) Philippians, Polycarp instead identifies himself as:</p>

<p class="colorfulgrid-accent">Polycarp, and the presbyters with him, to the
Church of God sojourning at Philippi: Mercy to you, and peace from God
Almighty, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, be multiplied. (Polycarp,
<i class="calibre4">to</i> <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">Philippians</i>, Introduction)</p>

<p class="msonormal1">This formula strongly implies a different semantic for
Church at Philippi, as well as for the other city-Churches of the European
West. In other words, the ‘Westerns’ were not yet using the term “bishop” to
mean the leading presbyter of a Church (e.g. Polycarp), but were still
apparently using the original New Testament terminology in which “bishop” and
“presbyter” were interchangeable terms. This being the case, it is no wonder
that Ignatius, Polycarp, and other contemporary (or earlier) patristic sources
do not impose the Asian terminology on Rome or the other early Western
city-Churches.</p>

<p class="msonormal1">As a result, the solution is a semantic one: there was no
‘later development’ of the office of bishop itself. Indeed if we only possessed
Polycarp’s “Epistle to the Philippians,” and not Ignatius’ two epistles “To
Smyrna” and “To Polycarp” (in which he repeatedly identifies Polycarp as the
monarchical bishop of Smyrna,) those who deny the existence of the episcopate would
probably argue that Polycarp was merely an ‘equal member’ of the Smyrnean
college of presbyters, as opposed to its presiding head. However, we find that
no early city-Church was ever governed by a ‘college of absolutely equal
presbyters.’ Rather, like the synagogue system that preceded the city-Church,
there was always a leading figure who presided as its head. And this model
becomes even more apparent when we turn to the Scriptural evidence.</p>
