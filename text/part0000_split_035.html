it. <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>John
came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that all might believe
through him. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>He was not the light, but [he was sent] to bear
witness to the light. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>The true light which enlightens everyone was
coming into the world.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">10</sup>He was in the world, and the world had come

he has explained him.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">John bears witness—The Lamb of God</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent
priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>He admitted and did not deny [it], [plainly]
admitting, “I am not the Christ!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">21</sup>They asked him, “What then? Are you Elias
(Elijah)?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">He said, “I am not!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">“Are you the prophet?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">He answered, “No.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Therefore, they asked him, “Who are you? Give
us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about
yourself?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>John said, “I am the voice of one crying in the
wilderness,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1018" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1018"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1018]</span></span></span></a>

as Isaias (Isaiah) the prophet said.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>Those who had been sent were from the
Pharisees. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>They asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are
not the Christ, nor Elias (Elijah), nor the prophet?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>John answered them, “I baptize in water, but
among you stands one whom you do not know.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1020" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1020"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1020]</span></span></span></a>

whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.” </p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>These things took place in Bethany beyond the
Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>The next day, John<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1022" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1022"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1022]</span></span></span></a>
saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the
sin of the world! <sup class="calibre31">30</sup>This is the one of whom I said, ‘After me comes
a man who is ranked before me, because he was before me.’ <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>I did
not know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: so that he would be
revealed to Israel.” <sup class="calibre31">32</sup>John bore witness, saying, “I saw the Spirit
descending as a dove out of heaven and remain on him. <sup class="calibre31">33</sup>I did not
know him, but the one who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘Upon whom
you will see the Spirit descending and remaining, this is he who baptizes in
the Holy Spirit.’ <sup class="calibre31">34</sup>Moreover, I myself have seen and testified that
this is the Son of God.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1023" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1023"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1023]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">35</sup>Again, the next day, John was standing with two
of his disciples. <sup class="calibre31">36</sup>He looked at Jesus as he was walking by and
said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” <sup class="calibre31">37</sup>The two disciples heard him
speak, and they began to follow Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">38</sup>Turning and seeing them
following, Jesus asked them, “What are you looking for?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher),
“where are you staying?”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">First disciples</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">39</sup>Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1024" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1024"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1024]</span></span></span></a>
said to them, “Come and see!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">They came therefore and saw where he was staying, and they
remained with him that day. (It was about the tenth hour).<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1025" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1025"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1025]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">40</sup>One of the two who heard John and who began to follow Jesus was
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. <sup class="calibre31">41</sup>He first found his own brother,
Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1026" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1026"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1026]</span></span></span></a>

brought him to Jesus who looked at him, and said, “You are Simon the son of
Jonah.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1029" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1029"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1029]</span></span></span></a>
You shall be called Kephas” (which translated means Peter). <sup class="calibre31">43</sup>On the
next day, being determined to go out into Galilee, Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1030" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1030"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1030]</span></span></span></a>
met Philip and said to him, “Follow me!” <sup class="calibre31">44</sup>Now Philip was from
Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. <sup class="calibre31">45</sup>Philip found Nathaniel
and said to him, “We have found the one of whom Moses in the law and the
prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">46</sup>Nathanael asked him, “Can anything good come
out of Nazareth?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Philip replied, “Come and see!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">47</sup>As Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, he said
about him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">48</sup>Nathanael asked Jesus, “How do you know me?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you,
when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">49</sup>Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of
God! You are King of Israel!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">50</sup>Jesus said to him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw
you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than
these!” <sup class="calibre31">51</sup>He said to Philip, “Amen, amen, I tell you; hereafter, you<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1031" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1031"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1031]</span></span></span></a>

<p class="sectiontopic">The wedding at Cana—First sign: the water changed into
wine</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_2">2</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">The third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and
the mother of Jesus was there. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Jesus also was invited with his
disciples to the wedding. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said
to him, “They have no wine.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Jesus said to her, “Woman, what [is that] to you
and me? My hour has not yet come.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">5</sup>His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he
tells you to do, do it.” <sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Now six water jars made of stone were set
there, meant for the rites of purification of the Jews, and they each contained
two or three measures.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1033" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1033"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1033]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">7</sup>Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water!” So they filled them
up to the brim. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>He then said to them, “Now draw some out, and take
it to the chief steward of the feast.” And they did so. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>When the
chief steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine (not knowing where
it had come from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the
bridegroom <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first,
and after the guests have drunk freely, then the inferior one. But you have
kept the good wine until now!” <sup class="calibre31">11</sup>This, the beginning of his signs,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1034" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1034"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1034]</span></span></span></a>
Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples
believed<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1035" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1035"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1035]</span></span></span></a>
in him.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and
his mother, his brothers,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1036" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1036"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1036]</span></span></span></a>
and his disciples; and they did not stay there [more than] a few days.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">A cleansing of the temple</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"> <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and
Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>In the temple, he found those who sold
oxen, sheep, and doves, as well as the money changers sitting [at their
booths]. <sup class="calibre31">15</sup>So, he made a whip of cords and drove [them] all out of
the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; he also poured out the changers’ money
and overthrew their tables. <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>To those who sold the doves, he said,
“Take these things out of here! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace!” <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Then
his disciples remembered that it was written:</p>

<p class="poetry1cxspfirst">“Zeal for your house will consume me.”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1037" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1037"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><b class="calibre7"><span class="calibre28">[1037]</span></b></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Therefore, the Jews declared, “What sign do you
show us, since you do these things?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this
sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up!”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1038" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1038"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1038]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>The Jews then said, “It took forty-six years to
build this sanctuary, and you will raise it up in three days?” <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>(But
he was speaking of the sanctuary of his body). <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>When therefore he
was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and
they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover,
during the feast, many began to believe in his Name, observing the signs which
he was performing. <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>But Jesus did not trust himself to them,
because he knew everyone, <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>and because he did not need a witness
about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</p>

<p class="style375ptloweredby15ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_3">3</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Now there was one of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader

by night, and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from
God because no one can perform the signs which you accomplish unless God is

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Jesus answered him, “Amen, amen, I tell you;

he cannot see the Kingdom of God.”</p>

of fragrance of pure nard, very precious; she anointed the feet of Jesus and
wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the
ointment. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, one of his disciples

for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to
steal what was put into it. <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>But Jesus said, “Leave her alone! She
has kept this for the day of my burial. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>For you always have the
poor with you, but you do not always have me.”</p>

cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” <sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Many of
the Jews read this inscription because the place where Jesus was crucified was
near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Then

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Now on the first [day] of the week,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1261" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1261"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1261]</span></span></span></a>
Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark. She saw that
the stone had been removed from the tomb. <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>At this, she ran [back]
and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and she
told them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know
where they have laid him!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Then Peter and the other disciple went out
toward the tomb. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Both ran together: the other disciple outran Peter
and arrived at the tomb first. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Bending over and looking inside, he
saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not enter in.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1262" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1262"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1262]</span></span></span></a>
<sup class="calibre31">6</sup>Then Simon Peter arrived, following him, and he entered into the
tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying, <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>and the cloth that had been
[placed] on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a
place by itself. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>Finally, the other disciple (who had arrived first
at the tomb) also entered in, and he saw and believed. <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>(For as yet,
they still did not understand the Scripture: that Jesus had to rise again from
the dead). <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>After this, the disciples returned to their own homes.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>However, Mary remained standing outside the
tomb, weeping. As she was crying, she stooped to look inside the tomb, <sup class="calibre31">12</sup>and
saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the
head, and one at the feet. <sup class="calibre31">13</sup>They asked her, “Woman, why are you
weeping?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">She answered, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I
do not know where they have laid him.” <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>Now after saying this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1263" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1263"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1263]</span></span></span></a>
that it was Jesus.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?
Who are you looking for?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Supposing him to be the gardener, she answered, “Sir, if you
have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
away.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Jesus said to her, “Mary!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">She turned around and said to him,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1264" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1264"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1264]</span></span></span></a>
“Rabbouni!”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1265" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1265"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1265]</span></span></span></a>
(which is to say, “Teacher!”)<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1266" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1266"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1266]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">17</sup>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold me, for I have
not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1267" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1267"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1267]</span></span></span></a>
and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
God.’”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1268" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1268"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1268]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that
she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Appearance to the disciples—Thomas</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31"><span class="calibre27">19</span></sup><span class="calibre27">In the evening on that [same] day (the first day
of the week), and as the doors [of the place] where the disciples were
assembled were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and
said, “Peace be with you.”</span></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>When he had said this, he showed them his hands
and his side. At this, the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Then
again, Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send
you.” <sup class="calibre31">22</sup>When he had said this, he breathed on them and told them, “Receive
the<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1269" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1269"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1269]</span></span></span></a>
Holy Spirit! <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if
you retain anyone’s sins, they are retained.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">24</sup>However, Thomas, called the Twin,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1270" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1270"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1270]</span></span></span></a>
one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>So the other
disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">But Thomas replied, “Unless I see in his hands the print of
the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not believe!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">26</sup>After eight days, his disciples were inside
once again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus
came and stood among them, and he said, “Peace be with you.” <sup class="calibre31">27</sup>Then
he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands! Place your hand
here and put it into my side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">28</sup>And Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">29</sup>Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1271" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1271"><span class="stylefootnotereferencelatinitalicblack"><span class="stylefootnotereferencelatinitalicblack"><span class="calibre28">[1271]</span></span></span></a>
you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">The Author’s Purpose</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">30</sup>Now Jesus accomplished many other signs in the
presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. <sup class="calibre31">31</sup>However,
these are written, so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that believing, you may have life in his Name.</p>

<p class="style38ptloweredby2ptlinespacingexactly2445pt" id="toc_21">21</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">After these things, Jesus manifested himself again to the
disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He manifested himself in this way: <sup class="calibre31">2</sup>Simon
Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathaniel of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee,
and two others of his disciples were together. <sup class="calibre31">3</sup>Simon Peter said to
them, “I am going fishing!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">They replied, “We are also coming with you!” At once, they
went out and got into the boat; however, they caught nothing that night. <sup class="calibre31">4</sup>Just
after daybreak, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not know that
it was Jesus. <sup class="calibre31">5</sup>Therefore, Jesus asked them, “Children, do you have
anything to eat?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">They answered him, “No!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">6</sup>He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side
of the boat, and you will find some.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">And so they cast the net, and now they were not able to draw
it in, because of the multitude of fish! <sup class="calibre31">7</sup>At this, that disciple
whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his
outer garment around him (for he was partly dressed)<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1272" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1272"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1272]</span></span></span></a>
and threw himself into the sea. <sup class="calibre31">8</sup>But the other disciples came in the
little boat dragging the net full of fish (for they were not far from the land,
but about a hundred yards<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1273" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1273"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1273]</span></span></span></a>
away). <sup class="calibre31">9</sup>When they got out on the shore, they saw a fire of coals
there, and fish laid on it, and bread. <sup class="calibre31">10</sup>Jesus told them, “Bring
some of the fish which you have just caught.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">11</sup>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land,
full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so
many, the net was not torn.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">12</sup>Jesus said to them, “Come and eat breakfast!”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Yet none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?”
knowing that it was the Lord.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">13</sup>Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it
to them, and the fish likewise. <sup class="calibre31">14</sup>This was now the third time that
Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">Jesus and Peter</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">15</sup>When they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus
asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah,<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1274" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1274"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1274]</span></span></span></a>
do you love<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1275" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1275"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1275]</span></span></span></a>
me more than these?”<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1276" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1276"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1276]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Peter replied, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1277" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1277"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1277]</span></span></span></a>
for you.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.” <sup class="calibre31">16</sup>Again,
Jesus asked a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1278" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1278"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1278]</span></span></span></a>
me?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Peter replied, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection
for you.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.” <sup class="calibre31">17</sup>A third
time, Jesus asked, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1279" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1279"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1279]</span></span></span></a>
for me?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Peter was grieved because Jesus<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1280" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1280"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1280]</span></span></span></a>
asked him the third time, “Do you have affection for me?” He said, “Lord, you
know everything! You know that I have affection for you.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep! <sup class="calibre31">18</sup>Amen, amen,
I tell you; when you were young, you dressed yourself, and you walked where you
wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another
will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">19</sup>Now Jesus said this to indicate by what kind of
death Peter would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to Peter, “Follow
me!”</p>

<p class="sectiontopic">About the beloved disciple—His Testimony</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">20</sup>Then Peter, turning around, saw that the
disciple whom Jesus loved was following [them]. (This was the disciple who had
also reclined near Jesus’ breast at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going
to betray you?”) <sup class="calibre31">21</sup>Peter, seeing him, asked Jesus, “Lord, what about
this man?”</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6"><sup class="calibre31">22</sup>Jesus answered, “If I desire that he stay until
I come, what is that to you? You follow me.” <sup class="calibre31">23</sup>Therefore, this
saying went out among the brethren, that this disciple would not die. Yet,
Jesus did not say to him that this disciple<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1281" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1281"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1281]</span></span></span></a>
would not die, but, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you?” <sup class="calibre31">24</sup>This is the disciple who bears witness about these things
and who wrote these things.</p>

<p class="body-text align-justify mt-6">We know that his testimony is true. <sup class="calibre31">25</sup>There are
also many other things which Jesus did. If they were all written, I suppose
that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
Amen.<a title="" href="part0000_split_125.html#_edn1282" class="pcalibre pcalibre1" id="_ednref1282"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="msoendnotereference"><span class="calibre28">[1282]</span></span></span></a></p>
